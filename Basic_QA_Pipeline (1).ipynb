Treatment should be \\ninitiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional \\ndays to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When appropriate, subsequent dose increases \\nshould be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg (see \\nsection 5.1). ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit \\nABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \\ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \\nfor ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \\nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \\n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \\nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \\nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established.

Currently available data are described \\nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \\nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \\naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients \\nwho have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in   5 \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole   6 \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or   7 \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nABILIFY tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \\nlapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh   8 \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with  \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \\nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \\nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed \\na significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \\nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.

These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12.

Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69;  \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline.  \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning.

ABILIFY is \\neffective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of \\n15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose. The \\nmaximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg \\nadministered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination \\ntherapy (see section 5.1). Some patients may benefit from a higher dose. The maximum daily dose \\nRecurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: for preventing recurrence of manic \\nepisodes in patients, who have been receiving aripiprazole as monotherapy or combination therapy, \\ncontinue therapy at the same dose. Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be \\nconsidered on the basis of clinical status. \\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older: the recommended dose for ABILIFY is \\n10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment should be \\ninitiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional \\ndays to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When appropriate, subsequent dose increases \\nshould be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg (see \\nsection 5.1). ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit \\nABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \\ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \\nfor ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \\nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \\n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \\nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \\nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \\nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents 6 to 18 years of age have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \\nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \\nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \\naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nThe orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapidly disperse in \\nsaliva. It can be taken with or without liquid. Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the \\nmouth is difficult. Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening \\nthe blister. Alternatively, disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension. \\nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients \\nwho have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8).  \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result  \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful \\nfor people with phenylketonuria. \\nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \\nintolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant  \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by  \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the \\nincidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients. In \\nanother long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated \\npatients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % \\nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, \\nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \\nwith lithium. In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \\nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \\nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \\nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \\naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \\nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of  \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \\nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \\nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \\nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \\nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \\nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \\nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \\npatients who received placebo. \\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older \\nIn a short-term placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 302 adolescents (13-17 years) with \\nschizophrenia, the frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar to those in adults except for \\nthe following reactions that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving aripiprazole than \\nin adults receiving aripiprazole (and more frequently than placebo): \\nSomnolence/sedation and extrapyramidal disorder were reported very commonly (â‰¥ 1/10), and dry \\nmouth, increased appetite, and orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, < 1/10). \\nThe safety profile in a 26-week open-label extension trial was similar to that observed in the short-\\nterm, placebo-controlled trial. \\nThe safety profile of a long-term, double-blind placebo controlled trial was also similar except for the \\nfollowing reactions that were reported more frequently than paediatric patients taking placebo: weight \\ndecreased, blood insulin increased, arrhythmia, and leukopenia were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, \\nIn the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13-17 years) with exposure up to 2 years, \\nincidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was 29.5 % and \\n48.3 %, respectively. In the adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole \\nexposure of 5 to 30 mg up to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) \\nand males (< 2 ng/ml) was 25.6 % and 45.0 %, respectively. \\nIn two long term trials with adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia and bipolar patients treated with \\naripiprazole, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was \\n37.0 % and 59.4 %, respectively. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older \\nThe frequency and type of adverse reactions in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder were similar to \\nthose in adults except for the following reactions: very commonly (â‰¥ 1/10) somnolence (23.0 %), \\nextrapyramidal disorder (18.4 %), akathisia (16.0 %), and fatigue (11.8 %); and commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, \\n< 1/10) abdominal pain upper, heart rate increased, weight increased, increased appetite, muscle \\nThe following adverse reactions had a possible dose response relationship; extrapyramidal disorder \\n(incidences were 10 mg, 9.1 %, 30 mg, 28.8 %, placebo, 1.7 %,); and akathisia (incidences were \\n10 mg, 12.1 %, 30 mg, 20.3 %, placebo, 1.7 %). \\nMean changes in body weight in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder at 12 and 30 weeks for \\naripiprazole were 2.4 kg and 5.8 kg, and for placebo 0.2 kg and 2.3 kg, respectively. \\nIn the paediatric population somnolence and fatigue were observed more frequently in patients with  \\nbipolar disorder compared to patients with schizophrenia. \\nIn the paediatric bipolar population (10-17 years) with exposure up to 30 weeks, incidence of low \\nserum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was 28.0 % and 53.3 %, \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \\noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \\nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \\naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \\nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \\nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, \\nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \\nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \\nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \\noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \\nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \\nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \\narrhythmias.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \\nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \\nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed \\na significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \\nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \\n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \\n314 adult patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \\nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \\n~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (n = 45, or \\nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \\nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \\naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days.  \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \\nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \\nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \\nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \\nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \\nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores â‰¤ 12) on aripiprazole \\n(10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive \\naripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in \\npreventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in \\npreventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %)  \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69; \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg  \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing.

At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \\nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation.

Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \\nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established.

In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established.

Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.  \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be  \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nThe oral solution contains fructose and sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \\nintolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take the \\nThe oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may \\ncause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).   \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.

In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion  \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \\nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \\nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed \\na significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \\nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.

Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \\nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \\nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \\nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing  \\nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores â‰¤ 12) on aripiprazole \\n(10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive \\naripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in \\npreventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in \\npreventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69; \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing. Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of \\nthe tablet formulation is 87 %.

At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \\nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \\nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \\nFollowing a single oral dose of [\\nC]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \\nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces. Less than 1 % of \\nunchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally as the solution. At equivalent doses, the peak \\nplasma concentrations of aripiprazole (C\\nmax) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic \\nexposure (AUC) was equivalent to tablets. In a relative bioavailability study comparing the \\npharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy \\nsubjects, the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean C\\nmax values was 122 % (n = 30). The single-\\ndose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole was linear and dose-proportional. \\nThe pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of \\nage were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights. \\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger \\nadult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female \\nsubjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant effects from \\nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \\npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \\nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar \\nin patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects. \\nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, \\nand C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver \\ncirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. \\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \\nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in \\nexcess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no \\nrelevance to clinical use.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \\nABILIFY 7.5 mg/ml solution for injection \\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \\nEach ml contains 7.5 mg of aripiprazole. Each vial contains 9.75 mg aripiprazole. \\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \\nClear, colourless, aqueous solution. \\nABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours \\nin adult patients with schizophrenia or with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is \\nTreatment with ABILIFY solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically \\nappropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated. \\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \\nThe recommended initial dose for ABILIFY solution for injection is 9.75 mg (1.3 ml), administered as \\na single intramuscular injection. The effective dose range of ABILIFY solution for injection is \\n5.25-15 mg as a single injection. A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given, on the basis of \\nindividual clinical status, which should also include consideration of medicinal products already \\nadministered either for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5). \\nA second injection may be administered 2 hours after the first injection, on the basis of individual \\nclinical status and no more than three injections should be given in any 24-hour period. \\nThe maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg (including all formulations of ABILIFY). \\nIf continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole, see the Summary of Product Characteristics \\nfor ABILIFY tablets, ABILIFY orodispersible tablets, or ABILIFY oral solution. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection in children and adolescents aged 0-17 years \\nhave not been established. No data are available. \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In  \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \\nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \\naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nABILIFY solution for injection is for intramuscular use. \\nTo enhance absorption and minimise variability, injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus \\nmaximus muscle, avoiding adipose regions, is recommended. \\nABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. \\nIt is ready to use and intended for short-term use only (see section 5.1). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nThe efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours has \\nnot been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nSimultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotics and parenteral benzodiazepine may be \\nassociated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression. If parenteral benzodiazepine \\ntherapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection, patients should be \\nmonitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.5). \\nPatients receiving ABILIFY solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension. \\nBlood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection has not been evaluated in patients with  \\nalcohol or medicinal product intoxication (either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products). \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken (see section 4.8). \\nIn clinical trials of treatment with oral aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable \\nto placebo. Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT \\nprolongation (see section 4.8). \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.  \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed oral \\naripiprazole. When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, \\nthyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce \\nclinically relevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with \\nbipolar mania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of \\ntreatment. Weight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain \\nis clinically significant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including  \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\nNo specific interaction studies have been performed with ABILIFY solution for injection. The \\ninformation below is obtained from studies with oral aripiprazole. \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY solution for injection \\nThe administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \\nABILIFY solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, \\nintramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously \\nwith intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination \\nas compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone. \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine)  \\nincreased aripiprazole AUC by 107 %, while C max was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose \\nshould be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration \\nof aripiprazole with quinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and \\nparoxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) \\nincreased aripiprazole AUC and C\\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nThe administration of ABILIFY solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \\nlorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, \\nintramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously \\nwith intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the \\ncombination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone. \\nIn clinical studies, oral doses of 10-30 mg/day of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the \\nmetabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), \\nCYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, \\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated \\nmetabolism in vitro. Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product \\ninteractions mediated by these enzymes. \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there  \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were nausea, dizziness and \\nsomnolence each occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with aripiprazole solution for \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

In \\nanother long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated \\npatients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % \\nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, \\nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \\nwith lithium. In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \\nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \\nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \\nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \\naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \\nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \\nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \\nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \\nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \\nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \\nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \\nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \\npatients who received placebo. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \\noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

Care must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of this medicinal \\nproduct into a blood vessel. Following any confirmed or suspected accidental overdose/inadvertent \\nintravenous administration, close observation of the patient is needed and if any potentially medically \\nserious sign or symptom develops, monitoring, which should include continuous electrocardiographic \\nmonitoring, is required. The medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient \\nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \\naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \\nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \\nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition,  \\nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \\nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \\nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \\noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \\nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \\nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \\narrhythmias. Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical \\nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \\nActivated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole C\\nabout 41 % and AUC by about 51 %, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of \\nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with \\naripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is \\nhighly bound to plasma proteins. \\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12 \\nIt has been proposed that aripiprazoleâ€™s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated \\nthrough a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D\\n2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and \\n2A receptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nAgitation in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder with ABILIFY solution for injection \\nIn two short- term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trials involving 554 schizophrenic adult patients \\npresenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, ABILIFYsolution for injection was associated \\nwith statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to \\nplacebo and was similar to haloperidol. \\nIn one short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder \\npresenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, ABILIFY solution for injection was associated  \\nwith statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to \\nplacebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam. The observed mean improvement from \\nbaseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for \\nplacebo, 9.6 for lorazepam, and 8.7 for ABILIFY solution for injection. In subpopulation analyses on \\npatients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation, a similar pattern of efficacy to the \\noverall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced \\nSchizophrenia with oral aripiprazole \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, oral aripiprazole was associated with \\nstatistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (oral aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly \\nhigher for patients on oral aripiprazole (43 %) than for oral haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating \\nscales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating \\nScale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, oral \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in oral aripiprazole group and \\nIn clinical trials oral aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \\n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \\n314 adult patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \\nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \\n~80.5 kg) on oral aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to oral olanzapine \\n(n = 45, or 33 % of evaluable patients). \\nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \\nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo.

These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12.

Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole administered intramuscularly as a single-dose to healthy subjects is well absorbed and \\nhas an absolute bioavailability of 100 %. The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an \\nintramuscular injection was 90 % greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet; systemic \\nexposure was generally similar between the 2 formulations. In 2 studies in healthy subjects the median \\ntimes to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dosing. \\nBased on results from trials with oral administration of aripiprazole, aripiprazole is widely distributed \\nthroughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/kg, indicating extensive \\nextravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are \\ngreater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \\nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \\nFollowing a single oral dose of [\\nC]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \\nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces.

The 518 events included 291 serious events of which 31 events were \\nfatal. 87 cases had medical history of confounding risk factors such as balance disorders, loss of \\nconsciousness, syncope, somnolence, extrapyramidal disorder, femoral fracture, alcohol abuse, bundle \\nbranch block, osteoporosis, knee arthroplasty, spinal fusion surgery, road traffic accident, fall, \\ntransient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, head injury and dementia with Lewy bodies and \\nconcomitant therapy with risperidone, quetiapine fumarate, clonazepam, Latuda, valium was a \\nconfounding factor in 172 cases. \\nMoreover there is also some evidence based on scientific literature that the use of antipsychotics (even \\nsecond generation antipsychotics like aripiprazole) is associated with an increase in the risk of falls \\nand fractures, especially among the older population. Additionally, it is known that the use of \\naripiprazole is associated with other ADR that may predispose to falls, such as somnolence, sedation, \\nThe US Product Information already mentions a class warning for antipsychotics since 2017. Other \\natypical antipsychotics already have a warning in EU SmPC. \\nIn this context, and given the seriousness of the consequences of falls, especially in elderly, the PRAC \\nbelieves that an update of the Product Information with inclusion of a warning in section 4.4 of the \\nOculogyric crisis: From post-marketing sources, there were 20 reports of oculogyric crisis during the \\ninterval (11 serious) and 244 reports cumulatively (92 serious). The PSUR for the brand leader, \\nAbilify and Abilify Maintena, gathers data from the immediate-realease formulations and the \\nprolonged-release suspension for injection. In this PSUR, there are 15 spontaneous reports of \\noculogyric crisis (8 serious) in the interval and 223 cumulatively (78 serious) for the oral formulations, \\ncomparing to 5 spontaneous reports of oculogyric crisis (3 serious) in the interval and 21 cumulatively \\n(14 serious) for the prolonged-release suspension for injection. Additionally, from the EudraVigilance \\ndatabase, at least one case is retrieved with a positive rechallenge, which conveys a probable causal \\nassociation of aripiprazole use with oculogyric crisis. There are a further 154 cumulative spontaneous \\nreports of eye movement disorder, of which 22 were serious. The SmPC for Abilify Maintena \\nprolonged-release suspension for injection lists oculogyric crisis in section 4.8 and the PIL lists \\nfixation of eye balls in one position as an uncommon side effect. For all other aripiprazole products, \\noculogyric crisis is not listed. All the other formulations only state in section 4.8 that dystonia is a \\nclass effect of this medication. A number of symptoms of dystonia are then listed, including spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. In this section, there is no mention of eye movement \\ndisorders. The PIL for these products have similar warnings regarding muscle spasms, swallowing \\ndifficulty and breathing difficulty but again no mention of eye movement disorders. Given that \\ndystonia is a well-known side effect of this drug and the large number of reported cases it seems likely \\nthat aripiprazole can cause oculogyric crisis. It is likely that healthcare professionals would be able to \\ndiagnose oculogyric crisis as dystonia and therefore attribute this symptom to aripiprazole, however it \\nis unlikely that patients would be able to link the eye movements to any of the side effects listed in the \\nPIL. Based on the available data, this condition should be listed in all aripiprazole containing products \\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) \\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for aripiprazole the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing aripiprazole is unchanged subject to the proposed \\nchanges to the product information. \\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

It is \\nnot intended to provide practical advice on how to use Abilify. \\nFor practical information about using Abilify, patients should read the package leaflet or contact their \\nWhat is Abilify and what is it used for? \\nAbilify is an antipsychotic medicine for patients with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. \\nIn schizophrenia, a mental illness with symptoms such as delusions, disorganised speech, and \\nhallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), Abilify is used to treat patients from the \\nIn bipolar I disorder, Abilify is used in adults to treat manic episodes (periods of abnormally high \\nmood) and to prevent new ones in those who have responded to the medicine in the past. It can also \\nbe used for up to 12 weeks to treat manic episodes in adolescents from the age of 13 years. \\nAbilify contains the active substance aripiprazole. \\nAbilify is available as tablets and a liquid to be taken by mouth. It is also available as a solution for \\ninjection into the shoulder or buttock muscle. The injection is used only for quickly controlling agitation \\nor disturbed behaviour in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. For information on the dose \\nand dose adjustments, see the package leaflet. \\nAbilify can only be obtained with a prescription.  \\nThe active substance in Abilify is aripiprazole. The exact way it works is not known but it attaches in \\nthe brain to receptors for two substances (neurotransmitters) called dopamine and serotonin (5HT), \\nwhich are believed to play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. By attaching to these receptors, \\nit is thought that aripiprazole helps normalise the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic \\nsymptoms and preventing them from returning. \\nWhat benefits of Abilify have been shown in studies? \\nStudies showed that Abilify is effective at treating symptoms of schizophrenia using standard rating \\nscales (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, PANSS).  \\nIn studies of 1,203 adults, Abilify was more effective than placebo (a dummy treatment) at reducing \\nsymptoms. In another adult study, Abilify was as effective as haloperidol, another antipsychotic \\nmedicine, in preventing symptoms from returning over 1 year.  \\nAbilify has also been studied in 302 adolescents aged between 13 and 17, with results showing Abilify \\nto be more effective than placebo. \\nA study in 544 patients treated by injection for agitation and disturbed behaviour showed that \\nimprovement with Abilify over 24 hours was greater than with placebo and similar to that with \\nStudies in bipolar I disorder showed that Abilify is effective at treating manic episodes using standard \\nmeasurements such as the Young-Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scale. \\nIn 4 out of 5 studies in 1,900 adults, Abilify was more effective than placebo at reducing manic \\nsymptoms, with two of these studies showing that Abilify has a similar effect to haloperidol and to \\nlithium. Other studies showed that Abilify was more effective than placebo at preventing manic \\nepisodes in previously treated adults for up to 74 weeks, and when it was used as an add-on to \\nA study in 296 children and adolescents showed that Abilify was more effective than placebo at \\nreducing the manic symptoms in patients aged 13 years and older. \\nFinally, a study in 291 patients treated by injection for agitation and disturbed behaviour showed that \\nimprovement with Abilify was greater after 2 hours than with placebo and similar to that with \\nlorazepam (another medicine for treating agitation). \\nWhat is the risk associated with Abilify? \\nIn adults, the most common side effects when taking Abilify by mouth (occurring in up to 10 patients \\nin 100) are restlessness, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, extrapyramidal disorder (uncontrolled twitching or \\njerking), akathisia (a constant urge to move), tremor (shaking), dizziness, sleepiness, headache, \\nblurred vision, dyspepsia (heartburn), vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), constipation, salivary \\nhypersecretion (increased production of saliva), tiredness and diabetes. The side effects are similar in \\nadolescents, but sleepiness, extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia and tiredness are very common in this \\ngroup (in more than 1 in 10 adolescents).   \\nThe most common side effects with the injection (occurring in up to 10 patients in 100) are sleepiness, \\ndizziness and nausea.  For the full list of all side effects and restrictions, see the package leaflet. \\nStudies comparing Abilify to placebo or other medicines (such as haloperidol and lithium) show that \\nAbilify is effective at reducing symptoms of schizophrenia and at treating and preventing high moods in \\npatients with bipolar I disorder.  \\nIn addition, the injection has been shown to be effective at quickly controlling agitation or disturbing \\nbehaviour in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.  \\nWith regard to safety, the medicine has side effects comparable to those of other antipsychotics. The \\nAgencyâ€™s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) therefore decided that the benefits \\nof Abilify are greater than its risks and recommended its approval in the EU. \\nWhat measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of \\nRecommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe \\nand effective use of Abilify have been included in the summary of product characteristics and the \\nOther information about Abilify \\nThe European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for \\nThe full EPAR for Abilify can be found on the Agencyâ€™s website: \\nema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human \\nmedicines/European public assessment reports\\n .

Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit \\nABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \\ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \\nfor ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \\nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \\n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \\nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \\nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established.

In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced.

When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients \\nwho have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in   5 \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole   6 \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or   7 \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nABILIFY tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \\nlapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh   8 \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

In another 12-week trial, \\nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \\nwith lithium. In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \\nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \\nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \\nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \\naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \\nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \\nantipsychotic medicinal products.

Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \\nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \\npatients who received placebo. \\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older \\nIn a short-term placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 302 adolescents (13-17 years) with \\nschizophrenia, the frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar to those in adults except for \\nthe following reactions that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving aripiprazole than \\nin adults receiving aripiprazole (and more frequently than placebo): \\nSomnolence/sedation and extrapyramidal disorder were reported very commonly (â‰¥ 1/10), and dry \\nmouth, increased appetite, and orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, < 1/10). \\nThe safety profile in a 26-week open-label extension trial was similar to that observed in the short-\\nterm, placebo-controlled trial. \\nThe safety profile of a long-term, double-blind placebo controlled trial was also similar except for the \\nfollowing reactions that were reported more frequently than paediatric patients taking placebo: weight \\ndecreased, blood insulin increased, arrhythmia, and leukopenia were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, \\nIn the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13-17 years) with exposure up to 2 years, \\nincidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was 29.5 % and \\n48.3 %, respectively. In the adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole \\nexposure of 5 to 30 mg up to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) \\nand males (< 2 ng/ml) was 25.6 % and 45.0 %, respectively. \\nIn two long term trials with adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia and bipolar patients treated with \\naripiprazole, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was \\n37.0 % and 59.4 %, respectively. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older \\nThe frequency and type of adverse reactions in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder were similar to \\nthose in adults except for the following reactions: very commonly (â‰¥ 1/10) somnolence (23.0 %), \\nextrapyramidal disorder (18.4 %), akathisia (16.0 %), and fatigue (11.8 %); and commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, \\n< 1/10) abdominal pain upper, heart rate increased, weight increased, increased appetite, muscle \\nThe following adverse reactions had a possible dose response relationship; extrapyramidal disorder \\n(incidences were 10 mg, 9.1 %, 30 mg, 28.8 %, placebo, 1.7 %,); and akathisia (incidences were \\n10 mg, 12.1 %, 30 mg, 20.3 %, placebo, 1.7 %). \\nMean changes in body weight in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder at 12 and 30 weeks for \\naripiprazole were 2.4 kg and 5.8 kg, and for placebo 0.2 kg and 2.3 kg, respectively. \\nIn the paediatric population somnolence and fatigue were observed more frequently in patients with \\nbipolar disorder compared to patients with schizophrenia. \\nIn the paediatric bipolar population (10-17 years) with exposure up to 30 weeks, incidence of low \\nserum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was 28.0 % and 53.3 %, \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders  \\nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \\noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \\nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \\naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \\nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \\nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, \\nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \\nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \\nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \\noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \\nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \\nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \\narrhythmias.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with  \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \\nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \\nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed \\na significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \\nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \\n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \\n314 adult patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \\nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \\n~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (n = 45, or \\nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \\nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \\naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \\nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \\nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \\nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \\nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \\nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores â‰¤ 12) on aripiprazole \\n(10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive \\naripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in \\npreventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in \\npreventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69;  \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline.  \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing.

At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \\nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation.

Treatment \\nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \\n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \\nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \\nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established.

Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8).  \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result  \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful \\nfor people with phenylketonuria. \\nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain lactose.

Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant  \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by  \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.

The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo.

These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \\nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \\nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \\nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores â‰¤ 12) on aripiprazole \\n(10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive \\naripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in \\npreventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in \\npreventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %)  \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69; \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg  \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing. Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of \\nthe tablet formulation is 87 %.

At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \\nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation.

Some patients may benefit from a higher dose. The maximum \\ndaily dose should not exceed 30 mg. \\nRecurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: for preventing recurrence of manic \\nepisodes in patients, who have been receiving aripiprazole as monotherapy or combination therapy, \\ncontinue therapy at the same dose. Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be  \\nconsidered on the basis of clinical status. \\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older: the recommended dose for ABILIFY is \\n10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment should be \\ninitiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional \\ndays to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When appropriate, subsequent dose increases \\nshould be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg (see \\nsection 5.1). ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit \\nABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \\ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \\nfor ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \\nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \\n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \\nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8).

In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced.

Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.  \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be  \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nThe oral solution contains fructose and sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \\nintolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take the \\nThe oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may \\ncause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).   \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.

Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69; \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing. Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of \\nthe tablet formulation is 87 %. There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of \\nAripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of \\n4.9 l/kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \\nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \\nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \\nFollowing a single oral dose of [\\nC]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \\nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces. Less than 1 % of \\nunchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally as the solution. At equivalent doses, the peak \\nplasma concentrations of aripiprazole (C\\nmax) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic \\nexposure (AUC) was equivalent to tablets. In a relative bioavailability study comparing the \\npharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy \\nsubjects, the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean C\\nmax values was 122 % (n = 30). The single-\\ndose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole was linear and dose-proportional. \\nThe pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of \\nage were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights. \\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger \\nadult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female \\nsubjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant effects from \\nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \\npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \\nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar \\nin patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects. \\nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, \\nand C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver \\ncirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. \\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \\nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in \\nexcess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no \\nrelevance to clinical use.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \\nABILIFY 7.5 mg/ml solution for injection \\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \\nEach ml contains 7.5 mg of aripiprazole. Each vial contains 9.75 mg aripiprazole. \\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \\nClear, colourless, aqueous solution. \\nABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours \\nin adult patients with schizophrenia or with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is \\nTreatment with ABILIFY solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically \\nappropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated. \\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \\nThe recommended initial dose for ABILIFY solution for injection is 9.75 mg (1.3 ml), administered as \\na single intramuscular injection. The effective dose range of ABILIFY solution for injection is \\n5.25-15 mg as a single injection. A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given, on the basis of \\nindividual clinical status, which should also include consideration of medicinal products already \\nadministered either for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5). \\nA second injection may be administered 2 hours after the first injection, on the basis of individual \\nclinical status and no more than three injections should be given in any 24-hour period. \\nThe maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg (including all formulations of ABILIFY). \\nIf continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole, see the Summary of Product Characteristics \\nfor ABILIFY tablets, ABILIFY orodispersible tablets, or ABILIFY oral solution. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection in children and adolescents aged 0-17 years \\nhave not been established. No data are available. \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In  \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \\nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \\naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nABILIFY solution for injection is for intramuscular use. \\nTo enhance absorption and minimise variability, injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus \\nmaximus muscle, avoiding adipose regions, is recommended. \\nABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. \\nIt is ready to use and intended for short-term use only (see section 5.1). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nThe efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours has \\nnot been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nSimultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotics and parenteral benzodiazepine may be \\nassociated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression. If parenteral benzodiazepine \\ntherapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection, patients should be \\nmonitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.5). \\nPatients receiving ABILIFY solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension. \\nBlood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection has not been evaluated in patients with  \\nalcohol or medicinal product intoxication (either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products). \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken (see section 4.8). \\nIn clinical trials of treatment with oral aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable \\nto placebo. Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT \\nprolongation (see section 4.8). \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.  \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed oral \\naripiprazole. When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, \\nthyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce \\nclinically relevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with \\nbipolar mania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of \\ntreatment. Weight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain \\nis clinically significant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including  \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\nNo specific interaction studies have been performed with ABILIFY solution for injection. The \\ninformation below is obtained from studies with oral aripiprazole. \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY solution for injection \\nThe administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \\nABILIFY solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, \\nintramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously \\nwith intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination \\nas compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone. \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine)  \\nincreased aripiprazole AUC by 107 %, while C max was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose \\nshould be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration \\nof aripiprazole with quinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and \\nparoxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) \\nincreased aripiprazole AUC and C\\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nThe administration of ABILIFY solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \\nlorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, \\nintramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously \\nwith intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the \\ncombination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone. \\nIn clinical studies, oral doses of 10-30 mg/day of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the \\nmetabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), \\nCYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, \\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated \\nmetabolism in vitro. Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product \\ninteractions mediated by these enzymes. \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there  \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were nausea, dizziness and \\nsomnolence each occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with aripiprazole solution for \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \\nantipsychotic medicinal products.

In addition,  \\nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \\nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \\nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \\noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \\nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \\nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \\narrhythmias.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nAgitation in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder with ABILIFY solution for injection \\nIn two short- term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trials involving 554 schizophrenic adult patients \\npresenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, ABILIFYsolution for injection was associated \\nwith statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to \\nplacebo and was similar to haloperidol. \\nIn one short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder \\npresenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, ABILIFY solution for injection was associated  \\nwith statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to \\nplacebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam. The observed mean improvement from \\nbaseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for \\nplacebo, 9.6 for lorazepam, and 8.7 for ABILIFY solution for injection. In subpopulation analyses on \\npatients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation, a similar pattern of efficacy to the \\noverall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced \\nSchizophrenia with oral aripiprazole \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, oral aripiprazole was associated with \\nstatistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (oral aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly \\nhigher for patients on oral aripiprazole (43 %) than for oral haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating \\nscales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating \\nScale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, oral \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in oral aripiprazole group and \\nIn clinical trials oral aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \\n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \\n314 adult patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \\nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \\n~80.5 kg) on oral aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to oral olanzapine \\n(n = 45, or 33 % of evaluable patients). \\nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \\nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \\naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder with oral aripiprazole \\nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \\nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12.

Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole administered intramuscularly as a single-dose to healthy subjects is well absorbed and \\nhas an absolute bioavailability of 100 %. The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an \\nintramuscular injection was 90 % greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet; systemic \\nexposure was generally similar between the 2 formulations. In 2 studies in healthy subjects the median \\ntimes to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dosing. \\nBased on results from trials with oral administration of aripiprazole, aripiprazole is widely distributed \\nthroughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/kg, indicating extensive \\nextravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are \\ngreater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \\nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \\nFollowing a single oral dose of [\\nC]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \\nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces.

The 518 events included 291 serious events of which 31 events were \\nfatal. 87 cases had medical history of confounding risk factors such as balance disorders, loss of \\nconsciousness, syncope, somnolence, extrapyramidal disorder, femoral fracture, alcohol abuse, bundle \\nbranch block, osteoporosis, knee arthroplasty, spinal fusion surgery, road traffic accident, fall, \\ntransient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, head injury and dementia with Lewy bodies and \\nconcomitant therapy with risperidone, quetiapine fumarate, clonazepam, Latuda, valium was a \\nconfounding factor in 172 cases. \\nMoreover there is also some evidence based on scientific literature that the use of antipsychotics (even \\nsecond generation antipsychotics like aripiprazole) is associated with an increase in the risk of falls \\nand fractures, especially among the older population. Additionally, it is known that the use of \\naripiprazole is associated with other ADR that may predispose to falls, such as somnolence, sedation, \\nThe US Product Information already mentions a class warning for antipsychotics since 2017. Other \\natypical antipsychotics already have a warning in EU SmPC. \\nIn this context, and given the seriousness of the consequences of falls, especially in elderly, the PRAC \\nbelieves that an update of the Product Information with inclusion of a warning in section 4.4 of the \\nOculogyric crisis: From post-marketing sources, there were 20 reports of oculogyric crisis during the \\ninterval (11 serious) and 244 reports cumulatively (92 serious). The PSUR for the brand leader, \\nAbilify and Abilify Maintena, gathers data from the immediate-realease formulations and the \\nprolonged-release suspension for injection. In this PSUR, there are 15 spontaneous reports of \\noculogyric crisis (8 serious) in the interval and 223 cumulatively (78 serious) for the oral formulations, \\ncomparing to 5 spontaneous reports of oculogyric crisis (3 serious) in the interval and 21 cumulatively \\n(14 serious) for the prolonged-release suspension for injection. Additionally, from the EudraVigilance \\ndatabase, at least one case is retrieved with a positive rechallenge, which conveys a probable causal \\nassociation of aripiprazole use with oculogyric crisis. There are a further 154 cumulative spontaneous \\nreports of eye movement disorder, of which 22 were serious. The SmPC for Abilify Maintena \\nprolonged-release suspension for injection lists oculogyric crisis in section 4.8 and the PIL lists \\nfixation of eye balls in one position as an uncommon side effect. For all other aripiprazole products, \\noculogyric crisis is not listed. All the other formulations only state in section 4.8 that dystonia is a \\nclass effect of this medication. A number of symptoms of dystonia are then listed, including spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. In this section, there is no mention of eye movement \\ndisorders. The PIL for these products have similar warnings regarding muscle spasms, swallowing \\ndifficulty and breathing difficulty but again no mention of eye movement disorders. Given that \\ndystonia is a well-known side effect of this drug and the large number of reported cases it seems likely \\nthat aripiprazole can cause oculogyric crisis. It is likely that healthcare professionals would be able to \\ndiagnose oculogyric crisis as dystonia and therefore attribute this symptom to aripiprazole, however it \\nis unlikely that patients would be able to link the eye movements to any of the side effects listed in the \\nPIL. Based on the available data, this condition should be listed in all aripiprazole containing products \\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) \\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for aripiprazole the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing aripiprazole is unchanged subject to the proposed \\nchanges to the product information. \\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

It explains how the \\nAgency assessed the medicine to recommend its authorisation in the EU and its conditions of use. It is \\nnot intended to provide practical advice on how to use Abilify. \\nFor practical information about using Abilify, patients should read the package leaflet or contact their \\nWhat is Abilify and what is it used for? \\nAbilify is an antipsychotic medicine for patients with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. \\nIn schizophrenia, a mental illness with symptoms such as delusions, disorganised speech, and \\nhallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), Abilify is used to treat patients from the \\nIn bipolar I disorder, Abilify is used in adults to treat manic episodes (periods of abnormally high \\nmood) and to prevent new ones in those who have responded to the medicine in the past. It can also \\nbe used for up to 12 weeks to treat manic episodes in adolescents from the age of 13 years. \\nAbilify contains the active substance aripiprazole. \\nAbilify is available as tablets and a liquid to be taken by mouth. It is also available as a solution for \\ninjection into the shoulder or buttock muscle. The injection is used only for quickly controlling agitation \\nor disturbed behaviour in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. For information on the dose \\nand dose adjustments, see the package leaflet. \\nAbilify can only be obtained with a prescription.  \\nThe active substance in Abilify is aripiprazole. The exact way it works is not known but it attaches in \\nthe brain to receptors for two substances (neurotransmitters) called dopamine and serotonin (5HT), \\nwhich are believed to play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. By attaching to these receptors, \\nit is thought that aripiprazole helps normalise the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic \\nsymptoms and preventing them from returning. \\nWhat benefits of Abilify have been shown in studies? \\nStudies showed that Abilify is effective at treating symptoms of schizophrenia using standard rating \\nscales (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, PANSS).  \\nIn studies of 1,203 adults, Abilify was more effective than placebo (a dummy treatment) at reducing \\nsymptoms. In another adult study, Abilify was as effective as haloperidol, another antipsychotic \\nmedicine, in preventing symptoms from returning over 1 year.  \\nAbilify has also been studied in 302 adolescents aged between 13 and 17, with results showing Abilify \\nto be more effective than placebo. \\nA study in 544 patients treated by injection for agitation and disturbed behaviour showed that \\nimprovement with Abilify over 24 hours was greater than with placebo and similar to that with \\nStudies in bipolar I disorder showed that Abilify is effective at treating manic episodes using standard \\nmeasurements such as the Young-Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scale. \\nIn 4 out of 5 studies in 1,900 adults, Abilify was more effective than placebo at reducing manic \\nsymptoms, with two of these studies showing that Abilify has a similar effect to haloperidol and to \\nlithium. Other studies showed that Abilify was more effective than placebo at preventing manic \\nepisodes in previously treated adults for up to 74 weeks, and when it was used as an add-on to \\nA study in 296 children and adolescents showed that Abilify was more effective than placebo at \\nreducing the manic symptoms in patients aged 13 years and older. \\nFinally, a study in 291 patients treated by injection for agitation and disturbed behaviour showed that \\nimprovement with Abilify was greater after 2 hours than with placebo and similar to that with \\nlorazepam (another medicine for treating agitation). \\nWhat is the risk associated with Abilify? \\nIn adults, the most common side effects when taking Abilify by mouth (occurring in up to 10 patients \\nin 100) are restlessness, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, extrapyramidal disorder (uncontrolled twitching or \\njerking), akathisia (a constant urge to move), tremor (shaking), dizziness, sleepiness, headache, \\nblurred vision, dyspepsia (heartburn), vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), constipation, salivary \\nhypersecretion (increased production of saliva), tiredness and diabetes. The side effects are similar in \\nadolescents, but sleepiness, extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia and tiredness are very common in this \\ngroup (in more than 1 in 10 adolescents).   \\nThe most common side effects with the injection (occurring in up to 10 patients in 100) are sleepiness, \\ndizziness and nausea.  For the full list of all side effects and restrictions, see the package leaflet. \\nStudies comparing Abilify to placebo or other medicines (such as haloperidol and lithium) show that \\nAbilify is effective at reducing symptoms of schizophrenia and at treating and preventing high moods in \\npatients with bipolar I disorder.  \\nIn addition, the injection has been shown to be effective at quickly controlling agitation or disturbing \\nbehaviour in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.  \\nWith regard to safety, the medicine has side effects comparable to those of other antipsychotics. The \\nAgencyâ€™s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) therefore decided that the benefits \\nof Abilify are greater than its risks and recommended its approval in the EU. \\nWhat measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of \\nRecommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe \\nand effective use of Abilify have been included in the summary of product characteristics and the \\nOther information about Abilify \\nThe European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for \\nThe full EPAR for Abilify can be found on the Agencyâ€™s website: \\nema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human \\nmedicines/European public assessment reports\\n .

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. \\nThis is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for Abilify. It explains how the \\nAgency assessed the medicine to recommend its authorisation in the EU and its conditions of use. It is \\nnot intended to provide practical advice on how to use Abilify. \\nFor practical information about using Abilify, patients should read the package leaflet or contact their \\nWhat is Abilify and what is it used for? \\nAbilify is an antipsychotic medicine for patients with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. \\nIn schizophrenia, a mental illness with symptoms such as delusions, disorganised speech, and \\nhallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), Abilify is used to treat patients from the \\nIn bipolar I disorder, Abilify is used in adults to treat manic episodes (periods of abnormally high \\nmood) and to prevent new ones in those who have responded to the medicine in the past. It can also \\nbe used for up to 12 weeks to treat manic episodes in adolescents from the age of 13 years. \\nAbilify contains the active substance aripiprazole. \\nAbilify is available as tablets and a liquid to be taken by mouth. It is also available as a solution for \\ninjection into the shoulder or buttock muscle. The injection is used only for quickly controlling agitation \\nor disturbed behaviour in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. For information on the dose \\nand dose adjustments, see the package leaflet. \\nAbilify can only be obtained with a prescription.  \\nThe active substance in Abilify is aripiprazole. The exact way it works is not known but it attaches in \\nthe brain to receptors for two substances (neurotransmitters) called dopamine and serotonin (5HT), \\nwhich are believed to play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. By attaching to these receptors, \\nit is thought that aripiprazole helps normalise the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic \\nsymptoms and preventing them from returning. \\nWhat benefits of Abilify have been shown in studies? \\nStudies showed that Abilify is effective at treating symptoms of schizophrenia using standard rating \\nscales (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, PANSS).  \\nIn studies of 1,203 adults, Abilify was more effective than placebo (a dummy treatment) at reducing \\nsymptoms. In another adult study, Abilify was as effective as haloperidol, another antipsychotic \\nmedicine, in preventing symptoms from returning over 1 year.  \\nAbilify has also been studied in 302 adolescents aged between 13 and 17, with results showing Abilify \\nto be more effective than placebo. \\nA study in 544 patients treated by injection for agitation and disturbed behaviour showed that \\nimprovement with Abilify over 24 hours was greater than with placebo and similar to that with \\nStudies in bipolar I disorder showed that Abilify is effective at treating manic episodes using standard \\nmeasurements such as the Young-Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scale. \\nIn 4 out of 5 studies in 1,900 adults, Abilify was more effective than placebo at reducing manic \\nsymptoms, with two of these studies showing that Abilify has a similar effect to haloperidol and to \\nlithium. Other studies showed that Abilify was more effective than placebo at preventing manic \\nepisodes in previously treated adults for up to 74 weeks, and when it was used as an add-on to \\nA study in 296 children and adolescents showed that Abilify was more effective than placebo at \\nreducing the manic symptoms in patients aged 13 years and older. \\nFinally, a study in 291 patients treated by injection for agitation and disturbed behaviour showed that \\nimprovement with Abilify was greater after 2 hours than with placebo and similar to that with \\nlorazepam (another medicine for treating agitation). \\nWhat is the risk associated with Abilify? \\nIn adults, the most common side effects when taking Abilify by mouth (occurring in up to 10 patients \\nin 100) are restlessness, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, extrapyramidal disorder (uncontrolled twitching or \\njerking), akathisia (a constant urge to move), tremor (shaking), dizziness, sleepiness, headache, \\nblurred vision, dyspepsia (heartburn), vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), constipation, salivary \\nhypersecretion (increased production of saliva), tiredness and diabetes. The side effects are similar in \\nadolescents, but sleepiness, extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia and tiredness are very common in this \\ngroup (in more than 1 in 10 adolescents).   \\nThe most common side effects with the injection (occurring in up to 10 patients in 100) are sleepiness, \\ndizziness and nausea.  For the full list of all side effects and restrictions, see the package leaflet. \\nStudies comparing Abilify to placebo or other medicines (such as haloperidol and lithium) show that \\nAbilify is effective at reducing symptoms of schizophrenia and at treating and preventing high moods in \\npatients with bipolar I disorder.  \\nIn addition, the injection has been shown to be effective at quickly controlling agitation or disturbing \\nbehaviour in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.  \\nWith regard to safety, the medicine has side effects comparable to those of other antipsychotics. The \\nAgencyâ€™s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) therefore decided that the benefits \\nof Abilify are greater than its risks and recommended its approval in the EU. \\nWhat measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of \\nRecommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe \\nand effective use of Abilify have been included in the summary of product characteristics and the \\nOther information about Abilify \\nThe European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for \\nThe full EPAR for Abilify can be found on the Agencyâ€™s website: \\nema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human \\nmedicines/European public assessment reports\\n .

Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit \\nABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \\ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \\nfor ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \\nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \\n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \\nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \\nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established.

When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients \\nwho have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in   5 \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole   6 \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or   7 \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nABILIFY tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \\nlapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh   8 \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with  \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \\nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \\nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed \\na significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \\nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.

These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12.

Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69;  \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline.  \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing.

ABILIFY is \\neffective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of \\n15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose. The \\nmaximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg \\nadministered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination \\ntherapy (see section 5.1). Some patients may benefit from a higher dose. The maximum daily dose \\nRecurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: for preventing recurrence of manic \\nepisodes in patients, who have been receiving aripiprazole as monotherapy or combination therapy, \\ncontinue therapy at the same dose. Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be \\nconsidered on the basis of clinical status. \\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older: the recommended dose for ABILIFY is \\n10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment should be \\ninitiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional \\ndays to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When appropriate, subsequent dose increases \\nshould be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg (see \\nsection 5.1). ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit \\nABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \\ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \\nfor ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \\nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \\n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \\nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \\nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \\nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents 6 to 18 years of age have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \\nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \\nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \\naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nThe orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapidly disperse in \\nsaliva. It can be taken with or without liquid. Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the \\nmouth is difficult. Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening \\nthe blister. Alternatively, disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension. \\nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients \\nwho have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8).  \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result  \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful \\nfor people with phenylketonuria. \\nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \\nintolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant  \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by  \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the \\nincidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients. In \\nanother long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated \\npatients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % \\nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, \\nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \\nwith lithium. In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \\nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \\nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \\nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \\naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \\nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of  \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \\nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \\nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \\nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \\nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \\nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \\nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \\npatients who received placebo. \\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older \\nIn a short-term placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 302 adolescents (13-17 years) with \\nschizophrenia, the frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar to those in adults except for \\nthe following reactions that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving aripiprazole than \\nin adults receiving aripiprazole (and more frequently than placebo): \\nSomnolence/sedation and extrapyramidal disorder were reported very commonly (â‰¥ 1/10), and dry \\nmouth, increased appetite, and orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, < 1/10). \\nThe safety profile in a 26-week open-label extension trial was similar to that observed in the short-\\nterm, placebo-controlled trial. \\nThe safety profile of a long-term, double-blind placebo controlled trial was also similar except for the \\nfollowing reactions that were reported more frequently than paediatric patients taking placebo: weight \\ndecreased, blood insulin increased, arrhythmia, and leukopenia were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, \\nIn the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13-17 years) with exposure up to 2 years, \\nincidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was 29.5 % and \\n48.3 %, respectively. In the adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole \\nexposure of 5 to 30 mg up to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) \\nand males (< 2 ng/ml) was 25.6 % and 45.0 %, respectively. \\nIn two long term trials with adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia and bipolar patients treated with \\naripiprazole, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was \\n37.0 % and 59.4 %, respectively. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older \\nThe frequency and type of adverse reactions in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder were similar to \\nthose in adults except for the following reactions: very commonly (â‰¥ 1/10) somnolence (23.0 %), \\nextrapyramidal disorder (18.4 %), akathisia (16.0 %), and fatigue (11.8 %); and commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, \\n< 1/10) abdominal pain upper, heart rate increased, weight increased, increased appetite, muscle \\nThe following adverse reactions had a possible dose response relationship; extrapyramidal disorder \\n(incidences were 10 mg, 9.1 %, 30 mg, 28.8 %, placebo, 1.7 %,); and akathisia (incidences were \\n10 mg, 12.1 %, 30 mg, 20.3 %, placebo, 1.7 %). \\nMean changes in body weight in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder at 12 and 30 weeks for \\naripiprazole were 2.4 kg and 5.8 kg, and for placebo 0.2 kg and 2.3 kg, respectively. \\nIn the paediatric population somnolence and fatigue were observed more frequently in patients with  \\nbipolar disorder compared to patients with schizophrenia. \\nIn the paediatric bipolar population (10-17 years) with exposure up to 30 weeks, incidence of low \\nserum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was 28.0 % and 53.3 %, \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \\noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \\nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \\naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \\nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \\nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, \\nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \\nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \\nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \\noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \\nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \\nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \\narrhythmias.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \\nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \\nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed \\na significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \\nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \\n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \\n314 adult patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \\nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \\n~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (n = 45, or \\nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \\nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \\naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days.  \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \\nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \\nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \\nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \\nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \\nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores â‰¤ 12) on aripiprazole \\n(10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive \\naripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in \\npreventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in \\npreventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %)  \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69; \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg  \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing.

At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \\nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation.

Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \\nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established.

In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established.

Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.  \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be  \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nThe oral solution contains fructose and sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \\nintolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take the \\nThe oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may \\ncause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).   \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.

In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion  \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \\nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \\nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed \\na significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \\nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.

Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \\nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \\nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \\nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing  \\nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores â‰¤ 12) on aripiprazole \\n(10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive \\naripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in \\npreventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in \\npreventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69; \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing. Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of \\nthe tablet formulation is 87 %.

At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \\nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \\nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \\nFollowing a single oral dose of [\\nC]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \\nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces. Less than 1 % of \\nunchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally as the solution. At equivalent doses, the peak \\nplasma concentrations of aripiprazole (C\\nmax) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic \\nexposure (AUC) was equivalent to tablets. In a relative bioavailability study comparing the \\npharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy \\nsubjects, the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean C\\nmax values was 122 % (n = 30). The single-\\ndose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole was linear and dose-proportional. \\nThe pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of \\nage were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights. \\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger \\nadult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female \\nsubjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant effects from \\nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \\npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \\nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar \\nin patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects. \\nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, \\nand C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver \\ncirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. \\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \\nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in \\nexcess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no \\nrelevance to clinical use.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \\nABILIFY 7.5 mg/ml solution for injection \\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \\nEach ml contains 7.5 mg of aripiprazole. Each vial contains 9.75 mg aripiprazole. \\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \\nClear, colourless, aqueous solution. \\nABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours \\nin adult patients with schizophrenia or with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is \\nTreatment with ABILIFY solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically \\nappropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated. \\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \\nThe recommended initial dose for ABILIFY solution for injection is 9.75 mg (1.3 ml), administered as \\na single intramuscular injection. The effective dose range of ABILIFY solution for injection is \\n5.25-15 mg as a single injection. A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given, on the basis of \\nindividual clinical status, which should also include consideration of medicinal products already \\nadministered either for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5). \\nA second injection may be administered 2 hours after the first injection, on the basis of individual \\nclinical status and no more than three injections should be given in any 24-hour period. \\nThe maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg (including all formulations of ABILIFY). \\nIf continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole, see the Summary of Product Characteristics \\nfor ABILIFY tablets, ABILIFY orodispersible tablets, or ABILIFY oral solution. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection in children and adolescents aged 0-17 years \\nhave not been established. No data are available. \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In  \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \\nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \\naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nABILIFY solution for injection is for intramuscular use. \\nTo enhance absorption and minimise variability, injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus \\nmaximus muscle, avoiding adipose regions, is recommended. \\nABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. \\nIt is ready to use and intended for short-term use only (see section 5.1). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nThe efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours has \\nnot been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nSimultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotics and parenteral benzodiazepine may be \\nassociated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression. If parenteral benzodiazepine \\ntherapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection, patients should be \\nmonitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.5). \\nPatients receiving ABILIFY solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension. \\nBlood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection has not been evaluated in patients with  \\nalcohol or medicinal product intoxication (either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products). \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken (see section 4.8). \\nIn clinical trials of treatment with oral aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable \\nto placebo. Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT \\nprolongation (see section 4.8). \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.  \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed oral \\naripiprazole. When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, \\nthyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce \\nclinically relevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with \\nbipolar mania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of \\ntreatment. Weight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain \\nis clinically significant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including  \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\nNo specific interaction studies have been performed with ABILIFY solution for injection. The \\ninformation below is obtained from studies with oral aripiprazole. \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY solution for injection \\nThe administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \\nABILIFY solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, \\nintramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously \\nwith intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination \\nas compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone. \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine)  \\nincreased aripiprazole AUC by 107 %, while C max was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose \\nshould be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration \\nof aripiprazole with quinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and \\nparoxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) \\nincreased aripiprazole AUC and C\\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nThe administration of ABILIFY solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \\nlorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, \\nintramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously \\nwith intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the \\ncombination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone. \\nIn clinical studies, oral doses of 10-30 mg/day of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the \\nmetabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), \\nCYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, \\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated \\nmetabolism in vitro. Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product \\ninteractions mediated by these enzymes. \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there  \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were nausea, dizziness and \\nsomnolence each occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with aripiprazole solution for \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

In \\nanother long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated \\npatients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % \\nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, \\nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \\nwith lithium. In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \\nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \\nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \\nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \\naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \\nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \\nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \\nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \\nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \\nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \\nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \\nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \\npatients who received placebo. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \\noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

Care must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of this medicinal \\nproduct into a blood vessel. Following any confirmed or suspected accidental overdose/inadvertent \\nintravenous administration, close observation of the patient is needed and if any potentially medically \\nserious sign or symptom develops, monitoring, which should include continuous electrocardiographic \\nmonitoring, is required. The medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient \\nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \\naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \\nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \\nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition,  \\nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \\nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \\nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \\noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \\nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \\nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \\narrhythmias. Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical \\nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \\nActivated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole C\\nabout 41 % and AUC by about 51 %, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of \\nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with \\naripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is \\nhighly bound to plasma proteins. \\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12 \\nIt has been proposed that aripiprazoleâ€™s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated \\nthrough a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D\\n2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and \\n2A receptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nAgitation in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder with ABILIFY solution for injection \\nIn two short- term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trials involving 554 schizophrenic adult patients \\npresenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, ABILIFYsolution for injection was associated \\nwith statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to \\nplacebo and was similar to haloperidol. \\nIn one short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder \\npresenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, ABILIFY solution for injection was associated  \\nwith statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to \\nplacebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam. The observed mean improvement from \\nbaseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for \\nplacebo, 9.6 for lorazepam, and 8.7 for ABILIFY solution for injection. In subpopulation analyses on \\npatients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation, a similar pattern of efficacy to the \\noverall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced \\nSchizophrenia with oral aripiprazole \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, oral aripiprazole was associated with \\nstatistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (oral aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly \\nhigher for patients on oral aripiprazole (43 %) than for oral haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating \\nscales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating \\nScale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, oral \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in oral aripiprazole group and \\nIn clinical trials oral aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \\n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \\n314 adult patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \\nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \\n~80.5 kg) on oral aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to oral olanzapine \\n(n = 45, or 33 % of evaluable patients). \\nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \\nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo.

These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12.

Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole administered intramuscularly as a single-dose to healthy subjects is well absorbed and \\nhas an absolute bioavailability of 100 %. The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an \\nintramuscular injection was 90 % greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet; systemic \\nexposure was generally similar between the 2 formulations. In 2 studies in healthy subjects the median \\ntimes to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dosing. \\nBased on results from trials with oral administration of aripiprazole, aripiprazole is widely distributed \\nthroughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/kg, indicating extensive \\nextravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are \\ngreater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \\nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \\nFollowing a single oral dose of [\\nC]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \\nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces.

The 518 events included 291 serious events of which 31 events were \\nfatal. 87 cases had medical history of confounding risk factors such as balance disorders, loss of \\nconsciousness, syncope, somnolence, extrapyramidal disorder, femoral fracture, alcohol abuse, bundle \\nbranch block, osteoporosis, knee arthroplasty, spinal fusion surgery, road traffic accident, fall, \\ntransient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, head injury and dementia with Lewy bodies and \\nconcomitant therapy with risperidone, quetiapine fumarate, clonazepam, Latuda, valium was a \\nconfounding factor in 172 cases. \\nMoreover there is also some evidence based on scientific literature that the use of antipsychotics (even \\nsecond generation antipsychotics like aripiprazole) is associated with an increase in the risk of falls \\nand fractures, especially among the older population. Additionally, it is known that the use of \\naripiprazole is associated with other ADR that may predispose to falls, such as somnolence, sedation, \\nThe US Product Information already mentions a class warning for antipsychotics since 2017. Other \\natypical antipsychotics already have a warning in EU SmPC. \\nIn this context, and given the seriousness of the consequences of falls, especially in elderly, the PRAC \\nbelieves that an update of the Product Information with inclusion of a warning in section 4.4 of the \\nOculogyric crisis: From post-marketing sources, there were 20 reports of oculogyric crisis during the \\ninterval (11 serious) and 244 reports cumulatively (92 serious). The PSUR for the brand leader, \\nAbilify and Abilify Maintena, gathers data from the immediate-realease formulations and the \\nprolonged-release suspension for injection. In this PSUR, there are 15 spontaneous reports of \\noculogyric crisis (8 serious) in the interval and 223 cumulatively (78 serious) for the oral formulations, \\ncomparing to 5 spontaneous reports of oculogyric crisis (3 serious) in the interval and 21 cumulatively \\n(14 serious) for the prolonged-release suspension for injection. Additionally, from the EudraVigilance \\ndatabase, at least one case is retrieved with a positive rechallenge, which conveys a probable causal \\nassociation of aripiprazole use with oculogyric crisis. There are a further 154 cumulative spontaneous \\nreports of eye movement disorder, of which 22 were serious. The SmPC for Abilify Maintena \\nprolonged-release suspension for injection lists oculogyric crisis in section 4.8 and the PIL lists \\nfixation of eye balls in one position as an uncommon side effect. For all other aripiprazole products, \\noculogyric crisis is not listed. All the other formulations only state in section 4.8 that dystonia is a \\nclass effect of this medication. A number of symptoms of dystonia are then listed, including spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. In this section, there is no mention of eye movement \\ndisorders. The PIL for these products have similar warnings regarding muscle spasms, swallowing \\ndifficulty and breathing difficulty but again no mention of eye movement disorders. Given that \\ndystonia is a well-known side effect of this drug and the large number of reported cases it seems likely \\nthat aripiprazole can cause oculogyric crisis. It is likely that healthcare professionals would be able to \\ndiagnose oculogyric crisis as dystonia and therefore attribute this symptom to aripiprazole, however it \\nis unlikely that patients would be able to link the eye movements to any of the side effects listed in the \\nPIL. Based on the available data, this condition should be listed in all aripiprazole containing products \\nThe CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. \\nGrounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) \\nOn the basis of the scientific conclusions for aripiprazole the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-\\nrisk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing aripiprazole is unchanged subject to the proposed \\nchanges to the product information. \\nThe CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \\nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established.

When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients \\nwho have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in   5 \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole   6 \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or   7 \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nABILIFY tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \\nlapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh   8 \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

In another 12-week trial, \\nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \\nwith lithium. In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \\nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \\nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \\nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \\naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \\nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \\nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \\nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \\nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \\nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \\nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \\nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \\npatients who received placebo. \\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older \\nIn a short-term placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 302 adolescents (13-17 years) with \\nschizophrenia, the frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar to those in adults except for \\nthe following reactions that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving aripiprazole than \\nin adults receiving aripiprazole (and more frequently than placebo): \\nSomnolence/sedation and extrapyramidal disorder were reported very commonly (â‰¥ 1/10), and dry \\nmouth, increased appetite, and orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, < 1/10). \\nThe safety profile in a 26-week open-label extension trial was similar to that observed in the short-\\nterm, placebo-controlled trial. \\nThe safety profile of a long-term, double-blind placebo controlled trial was also similar except for the \\nfollowing reactions that were reported more frequently than paediatric patients taking placebo: weight \\ndecreased, blood insulin increased, arrhythmia, and leukopenia were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, \\nIn the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13-17 years) with exposure up to 2 years, \\nincidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was 29.5 % and \\n48.3 %, respectively.

It \\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \\nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \\naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \\nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \\nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, \\nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \\nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \\nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \\noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \\nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \\nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \\narrhythmias.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with  \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \\nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \\nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed \\na significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \\nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \\n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \\n314 adult patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \\nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \\n~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (n = 45, or \\nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \\nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \\naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \\nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \\nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \\nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \\nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \\nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores â‰¤ 12) on aripiprazole \\n(10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive \\naripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in \\npreventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in \\npreventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69;  \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline.  \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing.

ABILIFY is \\neffective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of \\n15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose. The \\nmaximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg \\nadministered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination \\ntherapy (see section 5.1). Some patients may benefit from a higher dose. The maximum daily dose \\nRecurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: for preventing recurrence of manic \\nepisodes in patients, who have been receiving aripiprazole as monotherapy or combination therapy, \\ncontinue therapy at the same dose. Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be \\nconsidered on the basis of clinical status. \\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older: the recommended dose for ABILIFY is \\n10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment should be \\ninitiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional \\ndays to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When appropriate, subsequent dose increases \\nshould be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg (see \\nsection 5.1). ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit \\nABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \\ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \\nfor ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \\nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \\n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \\nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \\nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \\nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents 6 to 18 years of age have not yet been established. Currently available data are described \\nin section 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \\nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \\naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nThe orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapidly disperse in \\nsaliva. It can be taken with or without liquid. Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the \\nmouth is difficult. Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile, it should be taken immediately on opening \\nthe blister. Alternatively, disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension. \\nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients \\nwho have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8).  \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result  \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful \\nfor people with phenylketonuria. \\nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose \\nintolerance, the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant  \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by  \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the \\nincidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients. In \\nanother long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated \\npatients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % \\nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, \\nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \\nwith lithium. In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \\nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \\nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \\nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \\naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \\nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of  \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \\nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \\nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \\nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \\nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \\nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \\nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \\npatients who received placebo. \\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older \\nIn a short-term placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 302 adolescents (13-17 years) with \\nschizophrenia, the frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar to those in adults except for \\nthe following reactions that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving aripiprazole than \\nin adults receiving aripiprazole (and more frequently than placebo): \\nSomnolence/sedation and extrapyramidal disorder were reported very commonly (â‰¥ 1/10), and dry \\nmouth, increased appetite, and orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, < 1/10). \\nThe safety profile in a 26-week open-label extension trial was similar to that observed in the short-\\nterm, placebo-controlled trial. \\nThe safety profile of a long-term, double-blind placebo controlled trial was also similar except for the \\nfollowing reactions that were reported more frequently than paediatric patients taking placebo: weight \\ndecreased, blood insulin increased, arrhythmia, and leukopenia were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, \\nIn the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13-17 years) with exposure up to 2 years, \\nincidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was 29.5 % and \\n48.3 %, respectively. In the adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole \\nexposure of 5 to 30 mg up to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) \\nand males (< 2 ng/ml) was 25.6 % and 45.0 %, respectively. \\nIn two long term trials with adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia and bipolar patients treated with \\naripiprazole, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was \\n37.0 % and 59.4 %, respectively. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older \\nThe frequency and type of adverse reactions in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder were similar to \\nthose in adults except for the following reactions: very commonly (â‰¥ 1/10) somnolence (23.0 %), \\nextrapyramidal disorder (18.4 %), akathisia (16.0 %), and fatigue (11.8 %); and commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, \\n< 1/10) abdominal pain upper, heart rate increased, weight increased, increased appetite, muscle \\nThe following adverse reactions had a possible dose response relationship; extrapyramidal disorder \\n(incidences were 10 mg, 9.1 %, 30 mg, 28.8 %, placebo, 1.7 %,); and akathisia (incidences were \\n10 mg, 12.1 %, 30 mg, 20.3 %, placebo, 1.7 %). \\nMean changes in body weight in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder at 12 and 30 weeks for \\naripiprazole were 2.4 kg and 5.8 kg, and for placebo 0.2 kg and 2.3 kg, respectively. \\nIn the paediatric population somnolence and fatigue were observed more frequently in patients with  \\nbipolar disorder compared to patients with schizophrenia. \\nIn the paediatric bipolar population (10-17 years) with exposure up to 30 weeks, incidence of low \\nserum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was 28.0 % and 53.3 %, \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \\noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \\nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \\naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \\nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \\nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, \\nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \\nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \\nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \\noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \\nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \\nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \\narrhythmias. Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical \\nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \\nActivated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole C\\nabout 41 % and AUC by about 51 %, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of \\nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with \\naripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is \\nhighly bound to plasma proteins. \\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12 \\nIt has been proposed that aripiprazoleâ€™s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated  \\nthrough a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D 2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and \\n2A receptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \\nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \\nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed \\na significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \\nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \\n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \\n314 adult patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \\nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \\n~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (n = 45, or \\nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \\nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \\naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days.  \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \\nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \\nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \\nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \\nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \\nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores â‰¤ 12) on aripiprazole \\n(10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive \\naripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in \\npreventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in \\npreventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %)  \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69; \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg  \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing.

Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation.

Treatment should be \\ninitiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional \\ndays to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When appropriate, subsequent dose increases \\nshould be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg (see \\nsection 5.1). ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit \\nABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \\ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \\nfor ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \\nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \\n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \\nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8).

Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.  \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be  \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nThe oral solution contains fructose and sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \\nintolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take the \\nThe oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may \\ncause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).   \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \\naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \\nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \\nantipsychotic medicinal products.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.

In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion  \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \\nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \\nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed \\na significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \\nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.

Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69; \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing. Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of \\nthe tablet formulation is 87 %. There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of \\nAripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of \\n4.9 l/kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \\nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \\nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \\nFollowing a single oral dose of [\\nC]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \\nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces. Less than 1 % of \\nunchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally as the solution. At equivalent doses, the peak \\nplasma concentrations of aripiprazole (C\\nmax) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic \\nexposure (AUC) was equivalent to tablets. In a relative bioavailability study comparing the \\npharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy \\nsubjects, the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean C\\nmax values was 122 % (n = 30). The single-\\ndose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole was linear and dose-proportional. \\nThe pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of \\nage were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights. \\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger \\nadult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female \\nsubjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant effects from \\nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \\npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \\nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar \\nin patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects. \\nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, \\nand C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver \\ncirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. \\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \\nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in \\nexcess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no \\nrelevance to clinical use.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \\nABILIFY 7.5 mg/ml solution for injection \\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \\nEach ml contains 7.5 mg of aripiprazole. Each vial contains 9.75 mg aripiprazole. \\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \\nClear, colourless, aqueous solution. \\nABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours \\nin adult patients with schizophrenia or with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is \\nTreatment with ABILIFY solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically \\nappropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated. \\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \\nThe recommended initial dose for ABILIFY solution for injection is 9.75 mg (1.3 ml), administered as \\na single intramuscular injection. The effective dose range of ABILIFY solution for injection is \\n5.25-15 mg as a single injection. A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given, on the basis of \\nindividual clinical status, which should also include consideration of medicinal products already \\nadministered either for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5). \\nA second injection may be administered 2 hours after the first injection, on the basis of individual \\nclinical status and no more than three injections should be given in any 24-hour period. \\nThe maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg (including all formulations of ABILIFY). \\nIf continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole, see the Summary of Product Characteristics \\nfor ABILIFY tablets, ABILIFY orodispersible tablets, or ABILIFY oral solution. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection in children and adolescents aged 0-17 years \\nhave not been established. No data are available. \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In  \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \\nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \\naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nABILIFY solution for injection is for intramuscular use. \\nTo enhance absorption and minimise variability, injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus \\nmaximus muscle, avoiding adipose regions, is recommended. \\nABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. \\nIt is ready to use and intended for short-term use only (see section 5.1). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nThe efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours has \\nnot been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nSimultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotics and parenteral benzodiazepine may be \\nassociated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression. If parenteral benzodiazepine \\ntherapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection, patients should be \\nmonitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.5). \\nPatients receiving ABILIFY solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension. \\nBlood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection has not been evaluated in patients with  \\nalcohol or medicinal product intoxication (either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products). \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken (see section 4.8). \\nIn clinical trials of treatment with oral aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable \\nto placebo. Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT \\nprolongation (see section 4.8). \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.  \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed oral \\naripiprazole. When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, \\nthyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce \\nclinically relevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with \\nbipolar mania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of \\ntreatment. Weight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain \\nis clinically significant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including  \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\nNo specific interaction studies have been performed with ABILIFY solution for injection. The \\ninformation below is obtained from studies with oral aripiprazole. \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY solution for injection \\nThe administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \\nABILIFY solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, \\nintramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously \\nwith intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination \\nas compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone. \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine)  \\nincreased aripiprazole AUC by 107 %, while C max was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose \\nshould be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration \\nof aripiprazole with quinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and \\nparoxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) \\nincreased aripiprazole AUC and C\\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nThe administration of ABILIFY solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \\nlorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, \\nintramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously \\nwith intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the \\ncombination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone. \\nIn clinical studies, oral doses of 10-30 mg/day of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the \\nmetabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), \\nCYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, \\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated \\nmetabolism in vitro. Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product \\ninteractions mediated by these enzymes. \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there  \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were nausea, dizziness and \\nsomnolence each occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with aripiprazole solution for \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the \\nincidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients. In \\nanother long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated \\npatients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % \\nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, \\nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \\nwith lithium. In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \\nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \\nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \\nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \\naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \\nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \\nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \\nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \\nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \\nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \\nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \\nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \\npatients who received placebo. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \\noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

Healthcare \\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \\nNo cases of overdose associated with adverse reactions were reported in clinical studies with \\nABILIFY solution for injection. Care must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection of this medicinal \\nproduct into a blood vessel. Following any confirmed or suspected accidental overdose/inadvertent \\nintravenous administration, close observation of the patient is needed and if any potentially medically \\nserious sign or symptom develops, monitoring, which should include continuous electrocardiographic \\nmonitoring, is required. The medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient \\nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \\naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \\nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \\nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition,  \\nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \\nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \\nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \\noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \\nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \\nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \\narrhythmias. Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical \\nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \\nActivated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole C\\nabout 41 % and AUC by about 51 %, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of \\nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with \\naripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is \\nhighly bound to plasma proteins. \\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12 \\nIt has been proposed that aripiprazoleâ€™s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated \\nthrough a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D\\n2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and \\n2A receptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nAgitation in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder with ABILIFY solution for injection \\nIn two short- term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trials involving 554 schizophrenic adult patients \\npresenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, ABILIFYsolution for injection was associated \\nwith statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to \\nplacebo and was similar to haloperidol. \\nIn one short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder \\npresenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, ABILIFY solution for injection was associated  \\nwith statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to \\nplacebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam. The observed mean improvement from \\nbaseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for \\nplacebo, 9.6 for lorazepam, and 8.7 for ABILIFY solution for injection. In subpopulation analyses on \\npatients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation, a similar pattern of efficacy to the \\noverall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced \\nSchizophrenia with oral aripiprazole \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, oral aripiprazole was associated with \\nstatistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (oral aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly \\nhigher for patients on oral aripiprazole (43 %) than for oral haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating \\nscales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating \\nScale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, oral \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in oral aripiprazole group and \\nIn clinical trials oral aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \\n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \\n314 adult patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \\nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \\n~80.5 kg) on oral aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to oral olanzapine \\n(n = 45, or 33 % of evaluable patients). \\nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \\nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \\naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder with oral aripiprazole \\nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \\nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \\nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \\nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \\nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores â‰¤ 12) on aripiprazole \\n(10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive \\naripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in \\npreventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in \\npreventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole administered intramuscularly as a single-dose to healthy subjects is well absorbed and \\nhas an absolute bioavailability of 100 %. The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an \\nintramuscular injection was 90 % greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet; systemic \\nexposure was generally similar between the 2 formulations. In 2 studies in healthy subjects the median \\ntimes to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dosing. \\nBased on results from trials with oral administration of aripiprazole, aripiprazole is widely distributed \\nthroughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/kg, indicating extensive \\nextravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are \\ngreater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \\nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \\nFollowing a single oral dose of [\\nC]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \\nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces.

The 518 events included 291 serious events of which 31 events were \\nfatal. 87 cases had medical history of confounding risk factors such as balance disorders, loss of \\nconsciousness, syncope, somnolence, extrapyramidal disorder, femoral fracture, alcohol abuse, bundle \\nbranch block, osteoporosis, knee arthroplasty, spinal fusion surgery, road traffic accident, fall, \\ntransient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, head injury and dementia with Lewy bodies and \\nconcomitant therapy with risperidone, quetiapine fumarate, clonazepam, Latuda, valium was a \\nconfounding factor in 172 cases. \\nMoreover there is also some evidence based on scientific literature that the use of antipsychotics (even \\nsecond generation antipsychotics like aripiprazole) is associated with an increase in the risk of falls \\nand fractures, especially among the older population. Additionally, it is known that the use of \\naripiprazole is associated with other ADR that may predispose to falls, such as somnolence, sedation, \\nThe US Product Information already mentions a class warning for antipsychotics since 2017. Other \\natypical antipsychotics already have a warning in EU SmPC. \\nIn this context, and given the seriousness of the consequences of falls, especially in elderly, the PRAC \\nbelieves that an update of the Product Information with inclusion of a warning in section 4.4 of the \\nOculogyric crisis: From post-marketing sources, there were 20 reports of oculogyric crisis during the \\ninterval (11 serious) and 244 reports cumulatively (92 serious). The PSUR for the brand leader, \\nAbilify and Abilify Maintena, gathers data from the immediate-realease formulations and the \\nprolonged-release suspension for injection. In this PSUR, there are 15 spontaneous reports of \\noculogyric crisis (8 serious) in the interval and 223 cumulatively (78 serious) for the oral formulations, \\ncomparing to 5 spontaneous reports of oculogyric crisis (3 serious) in the interval and 21 cumulatively \\n(14 serious) for the prolonged-release suspension for injection. Additionally, from the EudraVigilance \\ndatabase, at least one case is retrieved with a positive rechallenge, which conveys a probable causal \\nassociation of aripiprazole use with oculogyric crisis. There are a further 154 cumulative spontaneous \\nreports of eye movement disorder, of which 22 were serious. The SmPC for Abilify Maintena \\nprolonged-release suspension for injection lists oculogyric crisis in section 4.8 and the PIL lists \\nfixation of eye balls in one position as an uncommon side effect. For all other aripiprazole products, \\noculogyric crisis is not listed. All the other formulations only state in section 4.8 that dystonia is a \\nclass effect of this medication. A number of symptoms of dystonia are then listed, including spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. In this section, there is no mention of eye movement \\ndisorders. The PIL for these products have similar warnings regarding muscle spasms, swallowing \\ndifficulty and breathing difficulty but again no mention of eye movement disorders. Given that \\ndystonia is a well-known side effect of this drug and the large number of reported cases it seems likely \\nthat aripiprazole can cause oculogyric crisis. It is likely that healthcare professionals would be able to \\ndiagnose oculogyric crisis as dystonia and therefore attribute this symptom to aripiprazole, however it \\nis unlikely that patients would be able to link the eye movements to any of the side effects listed in the \\nPIL.

It is \\nnot intended to provide practical advice on how to use Abilify. \\nFor practical information about using Abilify, patients should read the package leaflet or contact their \\nWhat is Abilify and what is it used for? \\nAbilify is an antipsychotic medicine for patients with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. \\nIn schizophrenia, a mental illness with symptoms such as delusions, disorganised speech, and \\nhallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), Abilify is used to treat patients from the \\nIn bipolar I disorder, Abilify is used in adults to treat manic episodes (periods of abnormally high \\nmood) and to prevent new ones in those who have responded to the medicine in the past. It can also \\nbe used for up to 12 weeks to treat manic episodes in adolescents from the age of 13 years. \\nAbilify contains the active substance aripiprazole. \\nAbilify is available as tablets and a liquid to be taken by mouth. It is also available as a solution for \\ninjection into the shoulder or buttock muscle. The injection is used only for quickly controlling agitation \\nor disturbed behaviour in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. For information on the dose \\nand dose adjustments, see the package leaflet. \\nAbilify can only be obtained with a prescription.  \\nThe active substance in Abilify is aripiprazole. The exact way it works is not known but it attaches in \\nthe brain to receptors for two substances (neurotransmitters) called dopamine and serotonin (5HT), \\nwhich are believed to play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. By attaching to these receptors, \\nit is thought that aripiprazole helps normalise the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic \\nsymptoms and preventing them from returning. \\nWhat benefits of Abilify have been shown in studies? \\nStudies showed that Abilify is effective at treating symptoms of schizophrenia using standard rating \\nscales (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, PANSS).  \\nIn studies of 1,203 adults, Abilify was more effective than placebo (a dummy treatment) at reducing \\nsymptoms. In another adult study, Abilify was as effective as haloperidol, another antipsychotic \\nmedicine, in preventing symptoms from returning over 1 year.  \\nAbilify has also been studied in 302 adolescents aged between 13 and 17, with results showing Abilify \\nto be more effective than placebo. \\nA study in 544 patients treated by injection for agitation and disturbed behaviour showed that \\nimprovement with Abilify over 24 hours was greater than with placebo and similar to that with \\nStudies in bipolar I disorder showed that Abilify is effective at treating manic episodes using standard \\nmeasurements such as the Young-Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scale. \\nIn 4 out of 5 studies in 1,900 adults, Abilify was more effective than placebo at reducing manic \\nsymptoms, with two of these studies showing that Abilify has a similar effect to haloperidol and to \\nlithium. Other studies showed that Abilify was more effective than placebo at preventing manic \\nepisodes in previously treated adults for up to 74 weeks, and when it was used as an add-on to \\nA study in 296 children and adolescents showed that Abilify was more effective than placebo at \\nreducing the manic symptoms in patients aged 13 years and older. \\nFinally, a study in 291 patients treated by injection for agitation and disturbed behaviour showed that \\nimprovement with Abilify was greater after 2 hours than with placebo and similar to that with \\nlorazepam (another medicine for treating agitation). \\nWhat is the risk associated with Abilify? \\nIn adults, the most common side effects when taking Abilify by mouth (occurring in up to 10 patients \\nin 100) are restlessness, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, extrapyramidal disorder (uncontrolled twitching or \\njerking), akathisia (a constant urge to move), tremor (shaking), dizziness, sleepiness, headache, \\nblurred vision, dyspepsia (heartburn), vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), constipation, salivary \\nhypersecretion (increased production of saliva), tiredness and diabetes. The side effects are similar in \\nadolescents, but sleepiness, extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia and tiredness are very common in this \\ngroup (in more than 1 in 10 adolescents).   \\nThe most common side effects with the injection (occurring in up to 10 patients in 100) are sleepiness, \\ndizziness and nausea.  For the full list of all side effects and restrictions, see the package leaflet. \\nStudies comparing Abilify to placebo or other medicines (such as haloperidol and lithium) show that \\nAbilify is effective at reducing symptoms of schizophrenia and at treating and preventing high moods in \\npatients with bipolar I disorder.  \\nIn addition, the injection has been shown to be effective at quickly controlling agitation or disturbing \\nbehaviour in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.  \\nWith regard to safety, the medicine has side effects comparable to those of other antipsychotics. The \\nAgencyâ€™s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) therefore decided that the benefits \\nof Abilify are greater than its risks and recommended its approval in the EU. \\nWhat measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of \\nRecommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe \\nand effective use of Abilify have been included in the summary of product characteristics and the \\nOther information about Abilify \\nThe European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for \\nThe full EPAR for Abilify can be found on the Agencyâ€™s website: \\nema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human \\nmedicines/European public assessment reports\\n .

The treatment duration should be the \\nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \\nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established.

In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced.

When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nOrodispersible tablets or oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients \\nwho have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in   5 \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole   6 \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or   7 \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nABILIFY tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the \\nlapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh   8 \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the \\nincidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients. In \\nanother long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated \\npatients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % \\nfor aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients. In another 12-week trial, \\nthe incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated \\nwith lithium. In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence \\nof EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients. \\nIn placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole \\nand 3.2 % with placebo. In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with \\naripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo. \\nClass effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in \\nsusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger \\nIn clinical trials for the approved indications and post-marketing, both increase and decrease in serum \\nprolactin as compared to baseline was observed with aripiprazole (section 5.1). \\nComparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially \\nclinically significant changes in routine laboratory and lipid parameters (see section 5.1) revealed no \\nmedically important differences. Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and \\nasymptomatic, were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of \\npatients who received placebo. \\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older \\nIn a short-term placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 302 adolescents (13-17 years) with \\nschizophrenia, the frequency and type of adverse reactions were similar to those in adults except for \\nthe following reactions that were reported more frequently in adolescents receiving aripiprazole than \\nin adults receiving aripiprazole (and more frequently than placebo): \\nSomnolence/sedation and extrapyramidal disorder were reported very commonly (â‰¥ 1/10), and dry \\nmouth, increased appetite, and orthostatic hypotension were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, < 1/10). \\nThe safety profile in a 26-week open-label extension trial was similar to that observed in the short-\\nterm, placebo-controlled trial. \\nThe safety profile of a long-term, double-blind placebo controlled trial was also similar except for the \\nfollowing reactions that were reported more frequently than paediatric patients taking placebo: weight \\ndecreased, blood insulin increased, arrhythmia, and leukopenia were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, \\nIn the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13-17 years) with exposure up to 2 years, \\nincidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was 29.5 % and \\n48.3 %, respectively. In the adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia population with aripiprazole \\nexposure of 5 to 30 mg up to 72 months, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ml) \\nand males (< 2 ng/ml) was 25.6 % and 45.0 %, respectively. \\nIn two long term trials with adolescent (13-17 years) schizophrenia and bipolar patients treated with \\naripiprazole, incidence of low serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was \\n37.0 % and 59.4 %, respectively. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older \\nThe frequency and type of adverse reactions in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder were similar to \\nthose in adults except for the following reactions: very commonly (â‰¥ 1/10) somnolence (23.0 %), \\nextrapyramidal disorder (18.4 %), akathisia (16.0 %), and fatigue (11.8 %); and commonly (â‰¥ 1/100, \\n< 1/10) abdominal pain upper, heart rate increased, weight increased, increased appetite, muscle \\nThe following adverse reactions had a possible dose response relationship; extrapyramidal disorder \\n(incidences were 10 mg, 9.1 %, 30 mg, 28.8 %, placebo, 1.7 %,); and akathisia (incidences were \\n10 mg, 12.1 %, 30 mg, 20.3 %, placebo, 1.7 %). \\nMean changes in body weight in adolescents with Bipolar I Disorder at 12 and 30 weeks for \\naripiprazole were 2.4 kg and 5.8 kg, and for placebo 0.2 kg and 2.3 kg, respectively. \\nIn the paediatric population somnolence and fatigue were observed more frequently in patients with \\nbipolar disorder compared to patients with schizophrenia. \\nIn the paediatric bipolar population (10-17 years) with exposure up to 30 weeks, incidence of low \\nserum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) was 28.0 % and 53.3 %, \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders  \\nPathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping and binge or compulsive eating can \\noccur in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.4). \\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \\nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \\nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \\nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \\nIn clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdose of \\naripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with \\nno fatalities. The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy, \\nincreased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. In addition, \\nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \\nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \\nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \\noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \\nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \\nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \\narrhythmias. Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, close medical \\nsupervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers. \\nActivated charcoal (50 g), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole C\\nabout 41 % and AUC by about 51 %, suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of \\nAlthough there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with \\naripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is \\nhighly bound to plasma proteins. \\n5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties \\nPharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, other antipsychotics, ATC code: N05AX12 \\nIt has been proposed that aripiprazoleâ€™s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated \\nthrough a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D\\n2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and \\n2A receptors. Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with  \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly higher \\nfor patients on aripiprazole (43 %) than for haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating scales used as \\nsecondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed \\na significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in \\nIn clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \\n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \\n314 adult patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \\nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \\n~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (n = 45, or \\nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \\nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \\naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder \\nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \\nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \\nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \\nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \\nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores â‰¤ 12) on aripiprazole \\n(10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive \\naripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in \\npreventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in \\npreventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69;  \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline.  \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing. Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of \\nthe tablet formulation is 87 %.

At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \\nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \\nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \\nFollowing a single oral dose of [\\nC]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \\nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces. Less than 1 % of \\nunchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged \\nThe pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of \\nage were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights. \\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger  \\nadult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female \\nsubjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant effects from \\nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \\npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \\nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar \\nin patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects. \\nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, \\nand C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver \\ncirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. \\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \\nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in \\nexcess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no \\nrelevance to clinical use. These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment \\naccumulation and/or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/kg/day (3 to \\n10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased \\nadrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas in female rats at \\n60 mg/kg/day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).

Treatment \\nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \\n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \\nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8). Doses higher than 10 mg/day should therefore \\nonly be used in exceptional cases and with close clinical monitoring (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). \\nYounger patients are at increased risk of experiencing adverse events associated with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, ABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients below 13 years of age (see sections 4.8 \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder: the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and \\nadolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established.

Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8).  \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result  \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful \\nfor people with phenylketonuria. \\nABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain lactose.

Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant  \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by  \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.

The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo.

These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12. Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic \\nremission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12. \\nIn a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or \\nvalproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as \\nadjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who \\nachieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, aripiprazole \\ndemonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into \\nIn a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I \\nDisorder who achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total scores â‰¤ 12) on aripiprazole \\n(10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, adjunctive \\naripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo with a 46 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in \\npreventing bipolar recurrence and a 65 % decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing \\nrecurrence into mania over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in \\npreventing recurrence into depression. Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %)  \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69; \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg  \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing. Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of \\nthe tablet formulation is 87 %.

At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \\nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation.

Some patients may benefit from a higher dose. The maximum \\ndaily dose should not exceed 30 mg. \\nRecurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder: for preventing recurrence of manic \\nepisodes in patients, who have been receiving aripiprazole as monotherapy or combination therapy, \\ncontinue therapy at the same dose. Adjustments of daily dosage, including dose reduction should be  \\nconsidered on the basis of clinical status. \\nSchizophrenia in adolescents aged 15 years and older: the recommended dose for ABILIFY is \\n10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment should be \\ninitiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for 2 additional \\ndays to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. When appropriate, subsequent dose increases \\nshould be administered in 5 mg increments without exceeding the maximum daily dose of 30 mg (see \\nsection 5.1). ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit \\nABILIFY is not recommended for use in patients with schizophrenia below 15 years of age due to \\ninsufficient data on safety and efficacy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older: the recommended dose \\nfor ABILIFY is 10 mg/day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals. Treatment \\nshould be initiated at 2 mg (using ABILIFY oral solution 1 mg/ml) for 2 days, titrated to 5 mg for \\n2 additional days to reach the recommended daily dose of 10 mg. The treatment duration should be the \\nminimum necessary for symptom control and must not exceed 12 weeks. Enhanced efficacy at doses \\nhigher than a daily dose of 10 mg has not been demonstrated, and a daily dose of 30 mg is associated \\nwith a substantially higher incidence of significant adverse reactions including EPS related events, \\nsomnolence, fatigue and weight gain (see section 4.8).

In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced.

Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken. \\nIn clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation (see \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment.  \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be  \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed aripiprazole. \\nWhen seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thyroid \\ndisorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically \\nrelevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with bipolar \\nmania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of treatment. \\nWeight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain is clinically \\nsignificant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nThe oral solution contains fructose and sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose \\nintolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take the \\nThe oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may \\ncause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).   \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect aripiprazole \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole \\nmax was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active \\nmetabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to \\napproximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of aripiprazole with \\nquinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be \\nexpected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied. \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) increased \\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nIn clinical studies, 10-30 mg/day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of \\nsubstrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), CYP2C9 (warfarin), \\nCYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, aripiprazole and dehydro-\\naripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro. Thus, \\naripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were akathisia and nausea \\neach occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with oral aripiprazole. \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors.

Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nIn a 6-week placebo-controlled trial involving 302 schizophrenic adolescent patients (13-17 years), \\npresenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically \\nsignificantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. In a sub-analysis of \\nthe adolescent patients between the ages of 15 to 17 years, representing 74 % of the total enrolled \\npopulation, maintenance of effect was observed over the 26-week open-label extension trial. \\nIn a 60- to 89-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescent subjects \\n(n = 146; ages 13-17 years) with schizophrenia, there was a statistically significant difference in the \\nrate of relapse of psychotic symptoms between the aripiprazole (19.39 %) and placebo (37.50 %) \\ngroups. The point estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.461 (95% confidence interval, 0.242-0.879) \\nin the full population. In subgroup analyses the point estimate of the HR was 0.495 for subjects 13 to \\n14 years of age compared to 0.454 for subjects 15 to 17 years of age. However, the estimation of the \\nHR for the younger (13-14 years) group was not precise, reflecting the smaller number of subjects in \\nthat group (aripiprazole, n = 29; placebo, n = 12), and the confidence interval for this estimation \\n(ranging from 0.151 to 1.628) did not allow conclusions to be drawn on the presence of a treatment \\neffect. In contrast the 95 % confidence interval for the HR in the older subgroup (aripiprazole, n = 69; \\nplacebo, n = 36) was 0.242 to 0.879 and hence a treatment effect could be concluded in the older \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in children and adolescents \\nAripiprazole was studied in a 30-week placebo-controlled trial involving 296 children and adolescents \\n(10-17 years), who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar I Disorder with manic or mixed episodes with or \\nwithout psychotic features and had a Y-MRS score â‰¥ 20 at baseline. Among the patients included in \\nthe primary efficacy analysis, 139 patients had a current co-morbid diagnosis of ADHD. \\nAripiprazole was superior to placebo in change from baseline at week 4 and at week 12 on the Y-MRS \\ntotal score. In a post-hoc analysis, the improvement over placebo was more pronounced in the patients \\nwith associated co-morbidity of ADHD compared to the group without ADHD, where there was no \\ndifference from placebo. Recurrence prevention was not established. \\nThe most common treatment-emergent adverse events among patients receiving 30 mg were \\nextrapyramidal disorder (28.3 %), somnolence (27.3 %), headache (23.2 %), and nausea (14.1 %). \\nMean weight gain in the 30 weeks treatment-interval was 2.9 kg as compared to 0.98 kg in patients \\nIrritability associated with autistic disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nAripiprazole was studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, placebo-controlled trials [one \\nflexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 52-week open-label \\ntrial. Dosing in these trials was initiated at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and \\nincreased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target dose. Over 75 % of patients were less than \\n13 years of age. Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy compared to placebo on the \\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this finding has \\nnot been established. The safety profile included weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The \\nduration of the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the pooled trials, the incidence of \\nlow serum prolactin levels in females (< 3 ng/ml) and males (< 2 ng/ml) in aripiprazole-treated \\npatients was 27/46 (58.7 %) and 258/298 (86.6 %), respectively. In the placebo-controlled trials, the \\nmean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 kg for aripiprazole. \\nAripiprazole was also studied in a placebo-controlled, long-term maintenance trial. After a 13-26 week \\nstabilisation on aripiprazole (2-15 mg/day) patients with a stable response were either maintained on \\naripiprazole or substituted to placebo for further 16 weeks. Kaplan-Meier relapse rates at week 16 \\nwere 35 % for aripiprazole and 52 % for placebo; the hazard ratio for relapse within 16 weeks \\n(aripiprazole/placebo) was 0.57 (non-statistically significant difference). The mean weight gain over \\nthe stabilisation phase (up to 26 weeks) on aripiprazole was 3.2 kg, and a further mean increase of \\n2.2 kg for aripiprazole as compared to 0.6 kg for placebo was observed in the second phase (16 weeks) \\nof the trial. Extrapyramidal symptoms were mainly reported during the stabilisation phase in 17 % of \\npatients, with tremor accounting for 6.5 %. \\nTics associated with Touretteâ€™s disorder in paediatric patients (see section 4.2) \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s disorder (aripiprazole: \\nn = 99, placebo: n = 44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 week study using a fixed \\ndose weight-based treatment group design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg. Patients were 7 - 17 years of age and presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic \\nScore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. Aripiprazole showed an \\nimprovement on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 mg \\nor 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 20 mg) as compared with an improvement of \\nThe efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with Touretteâ€™s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, \\nplacebo: n = 29) was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a starting \\ndose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in South-\\nKorea. Patients were 6 - 18 years and presented an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. \\nAripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to \\nweek 10 as compared with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group. \\nIn both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the efficacy findings has not been \\nestablished, considering the magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo effect and the \\nunclear effects regarding psycho-social functioning. No long term data are available with regard to the \\nefficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating disorder. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after \\ndosing. Aripiprazole undergoes minimal pre-systemic metabolism. The absolute oral bioavailability of \\nthe tablet formulation is 87 %. There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of \\nAripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of \\n4.9 l/kg, indicating extensive extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole \\nand dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \\nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \\nFollowing a single oral dose of [\\nC]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \\nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces. Less than 1 % of \\nunchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged \\nAripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally as the solution. At equivalent doses, the peak \\nplasma concentrations of aripiprazole (C\\nmax) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic \\nexposure (AUC) was equivalent to tablets. In a relative bioavailability study comparing the \\npharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy \\nsubjects, the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean C\\nmax values was 122 % (n = 30). The single-\\ndose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole was linear and dose-proportional. \\nThe pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of \\nage were similar to those in adults after correcting for the differences in body weights. \\nPharmacokinetics in special patient groups \\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger \\nadult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \\nThere are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female \\nsubjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in \\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant effects from \\nsmoking on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \\nPopulation pharmacokinetic evaluation showed no evidence of race-related differences on the \\npharmacokinetics of aripiprazole. \\nThe pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar \\nin patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects. \\nA single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, \\nand C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of \\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver \\ncirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity. \\nNon-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety \\npharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction \\nToxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in \\nexcess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no \\nrelevance to clinical use.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT \\nABILIFY 7.5 mg/ml solution for injection \\n2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION \\nEach ml contains 7.5 mg of aripiprazole. Each vial contains 9.75 mg aripiprazole. \\nFor the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. \\nClear, colourless, aqueous solution. \\nABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours \\nin adult patients with schizophrenia or with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is \\nTreatment with ABILIFY solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically \\nappropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated. \\n4.2 Posology and method of administration \\nThe recommended initial dose for ABILIFY solution for injection is 9.75 mg (1.3 ml), administered as \\na single intramuscular injection. The effective dose range of ABILIFY solution for injection is \\n5.25-15 mg as a single injection. A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given, on the basis of \\nindividual clinical status, which should also include consideration of medicinal products already \\nadministered either for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5). \\nA second injection may be administered 2 hours after the first injection, on the basis of individual \\nclinical status and no more than three injections should be given in any 24-hour period. \\nThe maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg (including all formulations of ABILIFY). \\nIf continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole, see the Summary of Product Characteristics \\nfor ABILIFY tablets, ABILIFY orodispersible tablets, or ABILIFY oral solution. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection in children and adolescents aged 0-17 years \\nhave not been established. No data are available. \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In patients \\nwith severe hepatic impairment, the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations. In  \\nthese patients dosing should be managed cautiously. However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg \\nshould be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). \\nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia or manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nDisorder in patients aged 65 years and older has not been established. Owing to the greater sensitivity \\nof this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see \\nNo dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2). \\nAccording to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers (see \\nDose adjustments due to interactions \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, \\nthe aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from \\nthe combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5). \\nWhen concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs, the \\naripiprazole dose should be increased. When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination \\ntherapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5). \\nABILIFY solution for injection is for intramuscular use. \\nTo enhance absorption and minimise variability, injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus \\nmaximus muscle, avoiding adipose regions, is recommended. \\nABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. \\nIt is ready to use and intended for short-term use only (see section 5.1). \\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \\n4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use \\nThe efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours has \\nnot been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I \\nSimultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotics and parenteral benzodiazepine may be \\nassociated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression. If parenteral benzodiazepine \\ntherapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection, patients should be \\nmonitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.5). \\nPatients receiving ABILIFY solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension. \\nBlood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly. \\nThe safety and efficacy of ABILIFY solution for injection has not been evaluated in patients with  \\nalcohol or medicinal product intoxication (either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products). \\nDuring antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient\\'s clinical condition may take several days \\nto some weeks. Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period. \\nThe occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in \\nsome cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic treatment, including \\ntreatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). Close supervision of high-risk patients should \\naccompany antipsychotic treatment. \\nAripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of \\nmyocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), \\ncerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, \\nhypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal products) or hypertension, including \\naccelerated or malignant. Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reported with \\nantipsychotic medicinal products. Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with \\nacquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole and preventive measures undertaken (see section 4.8). \\nIn clinical trials of treatment with oral aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable \\nto placebo. Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT \\nprolongation (see section 4.8). \\nIn clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent \\ndyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a \\npatient on aripiprazole, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered (see section 4.8). These \\nsymptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment. \\nIn paediatric clinical trials of aripiprazole akathisia and Parkinsonism were observed. If signs and \\nsymptoms of other EPS appear in a patient taking aripiprazole, dose reduction and close clinical \\nmonitoring should be considered. \\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) \\nNMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotics. In clinical trials, rare \\ncases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole. Clinical manifestations of NMS are \\nhyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular \\npulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may \\ninclude elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. \\nHowever, elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessarily in association with \\nNMS, have also been reported. If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or \\npresents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all \\nantipsychotics, including aripiprazole, must be discontinued. \\nIn clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.  \\nTherefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder \\nor have conditions associated with seizures (see section 4.8). \\nElderly patients with dementia-related psychosis \\nIn three placebo-controlled trials (n = 938; mean age: 82.4 years; range: 56-99 years) of aripiprazole in \\nelderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer\\'s disease, patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwere at increased risk of death compared to placebo. The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients \\nwas 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group. Although the causes of deaths were varied, most \\nof the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g. heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g. \\npneumonia) in nature (see section 4.8). \\nCerebrovascular adverse reactions \\nIn the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack), including \\nfatalities, were reported in patients (mean age: 84 years; range: 78-88 years). Overall, 1.3 % of \\naripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse reactions compared with 0.6 % of \\nplacebo-treated patients in these trials. This difference was not statistically significant. However, in \\none of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for \\ncerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is not indicated for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. \\nHyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus \\nHyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or \\ndeath, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole. Risk \\nfactors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of \\ndiabetes. In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates \\nof hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory \\nvalues compared to placebo. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse reactions in \\npatients treated with aripiprazole and with other atypical antipsychotics are not available to allow \\ndirect comparisons. Patients treated with any antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, should be \\nobserved for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and \\nweakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be \\nmonitored regularly for worsening of glucose control (see section 4.8). \\nHypersensitivity reactions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see \\nWeight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co-morbidities, use \\nof antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe \\ncomplications. Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed oral \\naripiprazole. When seen, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, \\nthyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma. In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce \\nclinically relevant weight gain in adults (see section 5.1). In clinical trials of adolescent patients with \\nbipolar mania, aripiprazole has been shown to be associated with weight gain after 4 weeks of \\ntreatment. Weight gain should be monitored in adolescent patients with bipolar mania. If weight gain \\nis clinically significant, dose reduction should be considered (see section 4.8). \\nOesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with the use of antipsychotics, including  \\naripiprazole. Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. \\nPathological gambling and other impulse control disorders \\nPatients can experience increased urges, particularly for gambling, and the inability to control these \\nurges while taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: increased sexual urges, compulsive \\nshopping, binge or compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive behaviours. It is important \\nfor prescribers to ask patients or their caregivers specifically about the development of new or \\nincreased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other \\nurges while being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that impulse-control symptoms can be \\nassociated with the underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were reported to have stopped \\nwhen the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may result \\nin harm to the patient and others if not recognised. Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication \\nif a patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole (see section 4.8). \\nPatients with ADHD comorbidity \\nDespite the high comorbidity frequency of Bipolar I Disorder and ADHD, very limited safety data are \\navailable on concomitant use of aripiprazole and stimulants; therefore, extreme caution should be \\ntaken when these medicinal products are co-administered. \\nAripiprazole may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may \\nlead to falls. Caution should be taken when treating patients at higher risk, and a lower starting dose \\nshould be considered (e.g., elderly or debilitated patients; see section 4.2).  \\n4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \\nNo specific interaction studies have been performed with ABILIFY solution for injection. The \\ninformation below is obtained from studies with oral aripiprazole. \\n1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of \\ncertain antihypertensive medicinal products. \\nGiven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is \\nadministered in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping adverse \\nreactions such as sedation (see section 4.8). \\nIf aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to cause QT \\nprolongation or electrolyte imbalance, caution should be used. \\nPotential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY solution for injection \\nThe administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \\nABILIFY solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, \\nintramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously \\nwith intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination \\nas compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone. \\n2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this \\neffect is deemed not clinically relevant. Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving \\nthe CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required \\nQuinidine and other CYP2D6 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine)  \\nincreased aripiprazole AUC by 107 %, while C max was unchanged. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32 % and 47 %, respectively. Aripiprazole dose \\nshould be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration \\nof aripiprazole with quinidine occurs. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and \\nparoxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be \\nKetoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors \\nIn a clinical trial of oral aripiprazole in healthy subjects, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 (ketoconazole) \\nincreased aripiprazole AUC and C\\nmax by 63 % and 37 %, respectively. The AUC and C max of dehydro-\\naripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 %, respectively. In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant \\nuse of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole \\ncompared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. When considering concomitant administration of \\nketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with aripiprazole, potential benefits should outweigh \\nthe potential risks to the patient. When concomitant administration of ketoconazole with aripiprazole \\noccurs, aripiprazole dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose. Other \\nstrong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may be expected to \\nhave similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied (see section 4.2). Upon \\ndiscontinuation of the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of aripiprazole should be increased \\nto the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy. When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. \\ndiltiazem) or CYP2D6 (e.g. escitalopram) are used concomitantly with aripiprazole, modest increases \\nin plasma aripiprazole concentrations may be expected. \\nCarbamazepine and other CYP3A4 inducers \\nFollowing concomitant administration of carbamazepine, a strong inducer of CYP3A4, and oral \\naripiprazole to patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the geometric means of C\\nand AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole \\n(30 mg) was administered alone. Similarly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of C\\nAUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower, respectively, than those \\nfollowing treatment with aripiprazole alone. Aripiprazole dose should be doubled when concomitant \\nadministration of aripiprazole occurs with carbamazepine. Concomitant administration of aripiprazole \\nand other inducers of CYP3A4 (such as rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, \\nefavirenz, nevirapine and St. John\\'s Wort) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose \\nincreases should therefore be applied. Upon discontinuation of strong CYP3A4 inducers, the dosage of \\naripiprazole should be reduced to the recommended dose. \\nWhen either valproate or lithium was administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no \\nclinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations and therefore no dose adjustment is \\nnecessary when either valproate or lithium is administered with aripiprazole. \\nPotential for aripiprazole to affect other medicinal products \\nThe administration of ABILIFY solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of \\nlorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly. However, in a single-dose, \\nintramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously \\nwith intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the \\ncombination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone. \\nIn clinical studies, oral doses of 10-30 mg/day of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the \\nmetabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/3-methoxymorphinan ratio), \\nCYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole), and CYP3A4 (dextromethorphan). Additionally, \\naripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated \\nmetabolism in vitro. Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product \\ninteractions mediated by these enzymes. \\nWhen aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate, lithium or lamotrigine, there  \\nwas no clinically important change in valproate, lithium or lamotrigine concentrations. \\nCases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients taking aripiprazole, and possible signs and \\nsymptoms for this condition can occur especially in cases of concomitant use with other serotonergic \\nmedicinal products, such as SSRI/SNRI, or with medicinal products that are known to increase \\naripiprazole concentrations (see section 4.8). \\n4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation \\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women. Congenital \\nanomalies have been reported; however, causal relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. \\nAnimal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3). Patients must be \\nadvised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during \\ntreatment with aripiprazole. Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by \\nanimal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the \\nexpected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \\nNewborn infants exposed to antipsychotics (including aripiprazole) during the third trimester of \\npregnancy are at risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms that \\nmay vary in severity and duration following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, \\nhypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. Consequently, newborn \\ninfants should be monitored carefully (see section 4.8). \\nAripiprazole is excreted in human milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue \\nbreast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from aripiprazole therapy taking into account the benefit of \\nbreast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. \\nAripiprazole did not impair fertility based on data from reproductive toxicity studies. \\n4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines \\nAripiprazole has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to potential \\nnervous system and visual effects, such as sedation, somnolence, syncope, vision blurred, diplopia (see \\nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions in placebo-controlled trials were nausea, dizziness and \\nsomnolence each occurring in more than 3 % of patients treated with aripiprazole solution for \\nTabulated list of adverse reactions \\nThe incidences of the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) associated with aripiprazole therapy are \\ntabulated below.

Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur \\nmore frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation \\nantipsychotic medicinal products.

In addition,  \\nreports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (up to 195 mg) in children have been received \\nwith no fatalities. The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included \\nsomnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms. \\nManagement of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, \\noxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. The possibility of multiple medicinal \\nproduct involvement should be considered. Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started \\nimmediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible \\narrhythmias.

Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal \\nmodels of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic \\nhypoactivity. Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D\\n1A and 5-HT2A receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D 4, serotonin 5-HT2C and 5-HT7, \\nalpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H\\n1 receptors. Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity \\nfor the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors. Interaction with \\nreceptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of \\nAripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks \\nproduced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of \\nC-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, to the \\ncaudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography. \\nAgitation in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder with ABILIFY solution for injection \\nIn two short- term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trials involving 554 schizophrenic adult patients \\npresenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, ABILIFYsolution for injection was associated \\nwith statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to \\nplacebo and was similar to haloperidol. \\nIn one short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder \\npresenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, ABILIFY solution for injection was associated  \\nwith statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/behavioural symptoms compared to \\nplacebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam. The observed mean improvement from \\nbaseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for \\nplacebo, 9.6 for lorazepam, and 8.7 for ABILIFY solution for injection. In subpopulation analyses on \\npatients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation, a similar pattern of efficacy to the \\noverall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced \\nSchizophrenia with oral aripiprazole \\nIn three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic adult \\npatients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, oral aripiprazole was associated with \\nstatistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo. \\nAripiprazole is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in adult \\npatients who have shown an initial treatment response. In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion \\nof responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both \\ngroups (oral aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 %). The overall completion rate was significantly \\nhigher for patients on oral aripiprazole (43 %) than for oral haloperidol (30 %). Actual scores in rating \\nscales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating \\nScale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol. \\nIn a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, oral \\naripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34 % in oral aripiprazole group and \\nIn clinical trials oral aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain. In a \\n26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included \\n314 adult patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at \\nleast 7 % weight gain over baseline (i.e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of \\n~80.5 kg) on oral aripiprazole (n = 18, or 13 % of evaluable patients), compared to oral olanzapine \\n(n = 45, or 33 % of evaluable patients). \\nIn a pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole \\nhas not been shown to induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, \\nProlactin levels were evaluated in all trials of all doses of aripiprazole (n = 28,242). The incidence of \\nhyperprolactinaemia or increased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole (0.3 %) was \\nsimilar to that of placebo (0.2 %). For patients receiving aripiprazole, the median time to onset was \\n42 days and median duration was 34 days. \\nThe incidence of hypoprolactinaemia or decreased serum prolactin in patients treated with aripiprazole \\nwas 0.4 %, compared with 0.02 % for patients treated with placebo. For patients receiving \\naripiprazole, the median time to onset was 30 days and median duration was 194 days. \\nManic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder with oral aripiprazole \\nIn two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in \\nreduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks. These trials included patients with or without psychotic \\nfeatures and with or without a rapid-cycling course. \\nIn one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or \\nmixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo. \\nIn two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed \\nepisode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior \\nefficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at \\nweek 12.

Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo \\non the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP Severity of Illness score (mania). In this trial, patients \\nwere assigned by investigators with either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to determine \\npartial non-response. Patients were stabilised for at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination \\nof aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the \\nsame mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were \\nassessed in the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + valproate; placebo + lithium; \\nplacebo + valproate. The Kaplan-Meier rates for recurrence to any mood episode for the adjunctive \\ntreatment arm were 16 % in aripiprazole + lithium and 18 % in aripiprazole + valproate compared to \\n45 % in placebo + lithium and 19 % in placebo + valproate. \\nThe European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with \\nABILIFY in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of schizophrenia and in \\nthe treatment of bipolar affective disorder (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). \\n5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties \\nAripiprazole administered intramuscularly as a single-dose to healthy subjects is well absorbed and \\nhas an absolute bioavailability of 100 %. The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an \\nintramuscular injection was 90 % greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet; systemic \\nexposure was generally similar between the 2 formulations. In 2 studies in healthy subjects the median \\ntimes to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dosing. \\nBased on results from trials with oral administration of aripiprazole, aripiprazole is widely distributed \\nthroughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/kg, indicating extensive \\nextravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are \\ngreater than 99 % bound to serum proteins, binding primarily to albumin. \\nAripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways: \\ndehydrogenation, hydroxylation, and N-dealkylation. Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 \\nenzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is \\ncatalysed by CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic \\ncirculation. At steady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, represents about 40 % of \\nThe mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers \\nof CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6. \\nThe total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/min/kg, which is primarily hepatic. \\nFollowing a single oral dose of [\\nC]-labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27 % of the administered \\nradioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces.

The 518 events included 291 serious events of which 31 events were \\nfatal. 87 cases had medical history of confounding risk factors such as balance disorders, loss of \\nconsciousness, syncope, somnolence, extrapyramidal disorder, femoral fracture, alcohol abuse, bundle \\nbranch block, osteoporosis, knee arthroplasty, spinal fusion surgery, road traffic accident, fall, \\ntransient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, head injury and dementia with Lewy bodies and \\nconcomitant therapy with risperidone, quetiapine fumarate, clonazepam, Latuda, valium was a \\nconfounding factor in 172 cases. \\nMoreover there is also some evidence based on scientific literature that the use of antipsychotics (even \\nsecond generation antipsychotics like aripiprazole) is associated with an increase in the risk of falls \\nand fractures, especially among the older population. Additionally, it is known that the use of \\naripiprazole is associated with other ADR that may predispose to falls, such as somnolence, sedation, \\nThe US Product Information already mentions a class warning for antipsychotics since 2017. Other \\natypical antipsychotics already have a warning in EU SmPC. \\nIn this context, and given the seriousness of the consequences of falls, especially in elderly, the PRAC \\nbelieves that an update of the Product Information with inclusion of a warning in section 4.4 of the \\nOculogyric crisis: From post-marketing sources, there were 20 reports of oculogyric crisis during the \\ninterval (11 serious) and 244 reports cumulatively (92 serious). The PSUR for the brand leader, \\nAbilify and Abilify Maintena, gathers data from the immediate-realease formulations and the \\nprolonged-release suspension for injection. In this PSUR, there are 15 spontaneous reports of \\noculogyric crisis (8 serious) in the interval and 223 cumulatively (78 serious) for the oral formulations, \\ncomparing to 5 spontaneous reports of oculogyric crisis (3 serious) in the interval and 21 cumulatively \\n(14 serious) for the prolonged-release suspension for injection. Additionally, from the EudraVigilance \\ndatabase, at least one case is retrieved with a positive rechallenge, which conveys a probable causal \\nassociation of aripiprazole use with oculogyric crisis. There are a further 154 cumulative spontaneous \\nreports of eye movement disorder, of which 22 were serious. The SmPC for Abilify Maintena \\nprolonged-release suspension for injection lists oculogyric crisis in section 4.8 and the PIL lists \\nfixation of eye balls in one position as an uncommon side effect. For all other aripiprazole products, \\noculogyric crisis is not listed. All the other formulations only state in section 4.8 that dystonia is a \\nclass effect of this medication. A number of symptoms of dystonia are then listed, including spasm of \\nthe neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty \\nbreathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. In this section, there is no mention of eye movement \\ndisorders. The PIL for these products have similar warnings regarding muscle spasms, swallowing \\ndifficulty and breathing difficulty but again no mention of eye movement disorders. Given that \\ndystonia is a well-known side effect of this drug and the large number of reported cases it seems likely \\nthat aripiprazole can cause oculogyric crisis. It is likely that healthcare professionals would be able to \\ndiagnose oculogyric crisis as dystonia and therefore attribute this symptom to aripiprazole, however it \\nis unlikely that patients would be able to link the eye movements to any of the side effects listed in the \\nPIL.

It explains how the \\nAgency assessed the medicine to recommend its authorisation in the EU and its conditions of use. It is \\nnot intended to provide practical advice on how to use Abilify. \\nFor practical information about using Abilify, patients should read the package leaflet or contact their \\nWhat is Abilify and what is it used for? \\nAbilify is an antipsychotic medicine for patients with schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. \\nIn schizophrenia, a mental illness with symptoms such as delusions, disorganised speech, and \\nhallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), Abilify is used to treat patients from the \\nIn bipolar I disorder, Abilify is used in adults to treat manic episodes (periods of abnormally high \\nmood) and to prevent new ones in those who have responded to the medicine in the past. It can also \\nbe used for up to 12 weeks to treat manic episodes in adolescents from the age of 13 years. \\nAbilify contains the active substance aripiprazole. \\nAbilify is available as tablets and a liquid to be taken by mouth. It is also available as a solution for \\ninjection into the shoulder or buttock muscle. The injection is used only for quickly controlling agitation \\nor disturbed behaviour in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. For information on the dose \\nand dose adjustments, see the package leaflet. \\nAbilify can only be obtained with a prescription.  \\nThe active substance in Abilify is aripiprazole. The exact way it works is not known but it attaches in \\nthe brain to receptors for two substances (neurotransmitters) called dopamine and serotonin (5HT), \\nwhich are believed to play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. By attaching to these receptors, \\nit is thought that aripiprazole helps normalise the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic \\nsymptoms and preventing them from returning. \\nWhat benefits of Abilify have been shown in studies? \\nStudies showed that Abilify is effective at treating symptoms of schizophrenia using standard rating \\nscales (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, PANSS).  \\nIn studies of 1,203 adults, Abilify was more effective than placebo (a dummy treatment) at reducing \\nsymptoms. In another adult study, Abilify was as effective as haloperidol, another antipsychotic \\nmedicine, in preventing symptoms from returning over 1 year.  \\nAbilify has also been studied in 302 adolescents aged between 13 and 17, with results showing Abilify \\nto be more effective than placebo. \\nA study in 544 patients treated by injection for agitation and disturbed behaviour showed that \\nimprovement with Abilify over 24 hours was greater than with placebo and similar to that with \\nStudies in bipolar I disorder showed that Abilify is effective at treating manic episodes using standard \\nmeasurements such as the Young-Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scale. \\nIn 4 out of 5 studies in 1,900 adults, Abilify was more effective than placebo at reducing manic \\nsymptoms, with two of these studies showing that Abilify has a similar effect to haloperidol and to \\nlithium. Other studies showed that Abilify was more effective than placebo at preventing manic \\nepisodes in previously treated adults for up to 74 weeks, and when it was used as an add-on to \\nA study in 296 children and adolescents showed that Abilify was more effective than placebo at \\nreducing the manic symptoms in patients aged 13 years and older. \\nFinally, a study in 291 patients treated by injection for agitation and disturbed behaviour showed that \\nimprovement with Abilify was greater after 2 hours than with placebo and similar to that with \\nlorazepam (another medicine for treating agitation). \\nWhat is the risk associated with Abilify? \\nIn adults, the most common side effects when taking Abilify by mouth (occurring in up to 10 patients \\nin 100) are restlessness, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, extrapyramidal disorder (uncontrolled twitching or \\njerking), akathisia (a constant urge to move), tremor (shaking), dizziness, sleepiness, headache, \\nblurred vision, dyspepsia (heartburn), vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), constipation, salivary \\nhypersecretion (increased production of saliva), tiredness and diabetes. The side effects are similar in \\nadolescents, but sleepiness, extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia and tiredness are very common in this \\ngroup (in more than 1 in 10 adolescents).   \\nThe most common side effects with the injection (occurring in up to 10 patients in 100) are sleepiness, \\ndizziness and nausea.  For the full list of all side effects and restrictions, see the package leaflet. \\nStudies comparing Abilify to placebo or other medicines (such as haloperidol and lithium) show that \\nAbilify is effective at reducing symptoms of schizophrenia and at treating and preventing high moods in \\npatients with bipolar I disorder.  \\nIn addition, the injection has been shown to be effective at quickly controlling agitation or disturbing \\nbehaviour in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.  \\nWith regard to safety, the medicine has side effects comparable to those of other antipsychotics. The \\nAgencyâ€™s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) therefore decided that the benefits \\nof Abilify are greater than its risks and recommended its approval in the EU. \\nWhat measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of \\nRecommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe \\nand effective use of Abilify have been included in the summary of product characteristics and the \\nOther information about Abilify \\nThe European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for \\nThe full EPAR for Abilify can be found on the Agencyâ€™s website: \\nema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human \\nmedicines/European public assessment reports\\n .
